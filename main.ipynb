      "\"is it something like that, where my red box is where your graph should be?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"ok, so then you have 4 blank boxes, have you put any numbers in there?\"\n",
      "\"yes  top left is 14\"\n",
      "\"below that is 3 next is 3 and far right is 14\"\n",
      "\"correct\"\n",
      "\"ok great\"\n",
      "\"now you have done a good job making sure that your points will be on the graph\"\n",
      "\"however, think about where they will be\"\n",
      "\"there are grid lines 3,5,7,9,11,13\"\n",
      "\"ok, those grid lines will change the more you change the numbers in the boxes\"\n",
      "\"let me show you something\"\n",
      "\"on the bottom nothing on the side\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"the points you told me would basically be on the outer edge of that box\"\n",
      "\"it's better to have some space around those to get a better view\"\n",
      "\"know what I mean?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"so if you want to put some space on the horizontal side, you just make a bigger difference between those values\"\n",
      "\"a little hint, it always helps to put 0 in the bottom left boxes\"\n",
      "\"ok i see\"\n",
      "\"then the same thing on the top and side ones, make those numbers a little bigger than your points\"\n",
      "\"any ideas?\"\n",
      "\"I did that as well.\"\n",
      "\"what did you use?\"\n",

      "\"ok\"\n",

      "\"How can I help?\"\n",
      "\"Were you the one just tutoring me about 5 minutes ago with another problem?\"\n",
      "\"Ok.\"\n",
      "\"Let me look at your file.\"\n",
      "\"Ok, we need to make the second term exponent positive.\"\n",
      "\"What would that result be?\"\n",
      "\"Is the problem written correctly?\"\n",
      "\"no, i sent you  a wrong attachment\"\n",
      "\"Ok.\"\n",
      "\"-9x^2 (-5^2) +5x/5^2 -8x^2\"\n",
      "\"Is the problem written correctly?\"\n",
      "\"yes, and the first thing I did is apply exponent to 5x/5^2 which is 25\"\n",
      "\"Ok, let me update.\"\n",
      "\"Can that fraction be reduced?\"\n",
      "\"yes, so it will be 5x?\"\n",
      "\"x/5 i meant\"\n",
      "\"Take another look.\"\n",
      "\"Ok.\"\n",
      "\"then what?\"\n",
      "\"Recall that (-5^2)=-25.\"\n",
      "\"That is the next step.\"\n",
      "\"yes, but would that be called \"\"apply exponent\"\"?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, exactly!\"\n",
      "\"Now multiply the result.\"\n",
      "\"Okay, I did select apply exponent but but it will not let me highlight just the (-5^2).\"\n",
      "\"This is where I keep getting stuck\"\n",
      "\"Can you send the screen shot?\"\n",
      "\"hold on\"\n",
      "\"Ok.\"\n",
      "\"Continue working on the file.\"\n",
      "\"Continue working.\"\n",
      "\"did you get it?\"\n",
      "\"No, not yet.\"\n",

      "\"File Shared > Doc1(2).docx\"\n",
      "\"not that one\"\n",
      "\"hold on\"\n",
      "\"Ok.\"\n",
      "\"I think that was the old file.\"\n",
      "\"I uploaded 3 times\"\n",

      "\"hold on\"\n",

      "\"There is no red x anywhere on the screen\"\n",
      "\"I think we can figure this out without the screen shot.\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"Let me update the whiteboard.\"\n",
      "\"So I am trying to change that (-5^2) to make it become (-25)  but it will not allow me to just pick (-5^2).\"\n",
      "\"it allows me to highlight -9x^2 (-5^2) but it is still incorrect.\"\n",
      "\"Lets go back to our last correct step.\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"Again, what was that?\"\n",
      "\"I simplified the 5x/25 to x/5\"\n",
      "\"Good.\"\n",
      "\"Did you receive a hint after that?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, it said to apply exponent to an expression raised to a power.\"\n",
      "\"That should be the first term.\"\n",
      "\"The -9x^2 ???\"\n",
      "\"I highlighted the first term too and it still came back as an error\"\n",
      "\"The first term is -9x^2(-5^2).\"\n",
      "\"I highlighted -9x^2 (-5^2) and it still came back as an error\"\n",
      "\"Can you highlight just (-5^2)?\"\n",
      "\"No, it comes back as an error also\"\n",
      "\"The only expression to simplify at this time is (-5^2).\"\n",
      "\"I think you may be having a software issue.\"\n",
      "\"Has this happened before?\"\n",

      "\"Hello Kimberly.\"\n",
      "\"I do not know what AMP rational number line is but I may be able to help you.\"\n",
      "\"Adaptive math practice\"\n",
      "\"Thank you.\"\n",
      "\"and I have to fine the numbers on the number line, some are negative and some are fractions and percents\"\n",
      "\"Maybe you can give me specific problems you have been working on.\"\n",
      "\"Are you attempting to put the numbers in order?\"\n",
      "\"represent 4.6 on the number line\"\n",
      "\"im trying to draw a number line on the board  its not going to well\"\n",
      "\"Can you add any labels; i.e. do specific tick marks have values associated with them?\"\n",
      "\"not sure what you mean\"\n",
      "\"I am talking about the number line as though it is a ruler.  At certain intervals, there are usually numbers as labels.\"\n",
      "\"ok I understand\"\n",
      "\"I know, for instance that 4.6 falls between 4 and 5.\"\n",
      "\"yes that the type of problems im working\"\n",
      "\"And 4.6 is slightly more than half way to 5 when starting at 4 since it is 4 and 6/10.\"\n",
      "\"I hope I am on the right track.\"\n",
      "\"I understand when it find 1/5  I know that's between 1 and 2 but when it's 249% Im lost\"\n",
      "\"Then let's discuss 249%.  Percent means parts out of 100.  Agree?\"\n",
      "\"agree\"\n",
      "\"So we can convert it to fraction form by dividing by 100 watch.\"\n",
      "\"We can convert from percent to decimal form by moving the decimal point two places to the left and dropping the percent symbol.\"\n",
      "\"I hope this makes sense.\"\n",
      "\"so that would fall between 2 and 3  closer to 2.50\"\n",
      "\"Yes, it would be just slightly to the left of 2.5 which is also 2.50.\"\n",
      "\"half way between the 2and 3 mark\"\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\"so when its a fraction like 3 3/12 how would I figure that out\"\n",
      "\"Good question.  3 and 3/12 is 3 plus a fraction.  3/12 will simplify to 1/4.\"\n",
      "\"I have -4.972 and I have no idea how to do that\"\n",
      "\"Okay, we can handle that one as well.  For now, let's ignore the negative sign.\"\n",
      "\"4.972 is between 4.900 and 5.000.  In fact, it is definitely closer to 5 than 4.9.  Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes I understand that, don't know what about the negative sign\"\n",
      "\"Since negative numbers are in the left direction, then -5 would be to the left of -4.9.  I will demonstrate.\"\n",
      "\"Does my diagram make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes, you make it look easy\"\n",
      "\"Remember that the absolute value of a number (i.e. without the sign) means the distance from zero.\"\n",
      "\"Negative numbers get more negative as they go to the left.\"\n",
      "\"can you show me how to work -3 4/7\"\n",
      "\"-4.972 is to the left of -4.9.\"\n",
      "\"Sure.\"\n",
      "\"I will start a new board.\"\n",
      "\"-3 and 4/7 is between -3 and -4.  Correct?\"\n",
      "\"so I have to look at where the -3 is on the line first ,\"\n",
      "\"That is a good start.\"\n",
      "\"i was trying to work the fraction\"\n",
      "\"Well the fraction is a number between 0 and 1, ignoring the sign for the time being.  In fact, 4/7 is slightly more than 1/2.  Okay so far?\"\n",
      "\"Remember that since 4 is slightly more than half of 7, then 4/7 is slightly more than 1/2.\"\n",
      "\"ok let me get this straight,  I look at the -3 first and find where it may be on the line and then figure out 4/7\"\n",
      "\"Yes.  The 4/7 tells us how far we move from the -3 to get to the -4.\"\n",
      "\"So we will be moving to the left of -3.\"\n",
      "\"And the 4/7 is also negative since it is part of the -3-4/7\"\n",
      "\"ok, i understand it better, i have to look at each piece of the number\"\n",
      "\"That can help.  Another way to look at it is to think that you are at point 0.  To get to the store, you have to move 3 and 4/7 miles in the negative direction.\"\n",
      "\"So you walk to the -3, a distance of 3 miles, and then you continue to walk in the same direction another 4/7 of a mile.\"\n",

      "\"what do I do if its - 29/6  am i suppose to look at the 29 and find it on the number line and then focus on the 6\"\n",
      "\"Not quite.  It helps to first convert it from fraction to mixed number or decimal form.\"\n",
      "\"First we would divide 29 by 6.  What is the quotient of that operation?\"\n",

      "\"like if its  6/7  when I see that I want to say 1 1/6 but sometimes im not sure\"\n",

      "\"I don't think so\"\n",
      "\"ok, it's a bit easier than the other factoring you've probably been working on...IF you can ignore pieces\"\n",

      "\"lol...what do you mean ignore pieces?\"\n",
      "\"if all you had was 5x^2 - 5x, what GCF could you factor out of it?\"\n",

      "\"I also saw an x (because one term has x^2 and the other has x--so it counts as part of the GCF)\"\n",
      "\"so that's where the 5x on the outside came from\"\n",
      "\"the x-1 on the inside came from what was \"\"left over\"\" when we factored out (or, divided by) the 5x\"\n",

      "\"Gotcha\"\n",
      "\"I'll try to remember that for when we move on to the right side (the blue terms)\"\n",
      "\"now, first of all, this is where most people make mistakes, even after they've gotten good at this method--see how the first \"\"blue\"\" term is negative?\"\n",
      "\"that means we need to factor out a negative GCF\"\n",
      "\"it's one of those things that's simple, so people forget\"\n",

      "\"are you still there?\"\n",
      "\"yes, I am printing our notes...-6x?  I am guessing.....\"\n",
      "\"ok. not a bad guess, but remember, we can only use x if both terms have x\"\n",
      "\"since that final term is just a number, our GCF will be just the number you said: -6\"\n",

      "\"but what about 6/-6?\"\n",
      "\"-1\"\n",

      "\"yes\\\"\n",
      "\"that part is ABSOLUTELY crucial! if they weren't EXACTLY the same, it would mean there was a mistake somewhere in the problem\"\n",
      "\"since they are EXACTLY the same, we can treat it like another GCF and factor it out!\"\n",

      "\"do you see how I pulled out the (x-1)s, just like we pulled out the 5x and the -6 earlier?\"\n",

      "\"seriously, maybe the whole week!\"\n",

      "\"remember, you can check these by multiplying out your answer to see if you get the original problem back\"\n",

      "\"ok....I see what you did......you combined the x-1 into one side and then the outside problem became the other half\"\n",

      "\"Have you learnt the \"\"Substitution Method\"\" to solve a system of linear equations?\"\n",
      "\"you take the x from the second equation and substitute it in for the y in the first equation\"\n",
      "\"Yes! Do you want to apply this method to solve the current problem?\"\n",
      "\"Aren't we suppose to or would it be easier to use elimination or what ever that word is\"\n",
      "\"Of course, you can use elimination. I'm not sure which method you've learnt. Do you want to use this approach instead?\"\n",
      "\"I would like to use the easier of the two to help me better understand this\"\n",
      "\"Sure. Let's use the elimination method and see if you understand\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"These are the two given equations, right?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Let's re-write the second equation a bit: add 6x to both sides\"\n",
      "\"Can you continue with this to simplify a bit?\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"so the -6x and the positive 6 will cancel out\"\n",
      "\"yes!\"\n",
      "\"and then i would take -3x + 6x and it would be -3x\"\n",
      "\"not really: we are dealing only with equation 2 (re-writing it), don't mix it with equation 1 yet\"\n",
      "\"so it would be 8y=-4\"\n",
      "\"what about the +6x at the very front? Does it vanish just like that?\"\n",
      "\"or 6x(8y)=-4\"\n",
      "\"i forgot about the 6\"\n",
      "\"ok. Do you mean 6x + 8y = -4 ?\"\n",
      "\"so we would move the plus in between\"\n",
      "\"yes, there is actually a \"\"+\"\" in front of the 8y, agree?\"\n",
      "\"(8 means +8)\"\n",
      "\"oh ok i see now\"\n",
      "\"Cool, so we have:\"\n",
      "\"let's try to simplify a bit more....\"\n",
      "\"how about dividing both sides by -2 ?\"\n",
      "\"is that because u added the 6 and 8\"\n",
      "\"well, in the left hand side, there is a +6x, and then there is a +8y. So it becomes 6x + 8y\"\n",
      "\"(the right hand side becomes -4, other terms are gone)\"\n",
      "\"And I suggest to divide both sides by -2 (you'll see the reason why later)\"\n",
      "\"ok i am really stupid so how did you come up with -2\"\n",
      "\"is it the least common factor\"\n",
      "\"Don't say so....yes, least common factor, and there is another reason for that (see later)\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Can you carry out dividing both sides by -2 on the board and see what you get?\"\n",
      "\"good, keep going....\"\n",
      "\"what is -4 divided by -2 ?\"\n",

      "\"Yes!\"\n",
      "\"and what is +8 divided by -2 ?\"\n",
      "\"-4\"\n",
      "\"right, so we actually have:\"\n",
      "\"Agree?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Did you see that equation 2 is actually identical to equation 1 after our little transformation?\"\n",
      "\"ha yes i do now.\"\n",
      "\"(that's why I suggested to divide by -2)\"\n",
      "\"i see will i always use the least common factor to solve these if i use the elimination\"\n",
      "\"Now, we proved to ourselves that the two given equations actually becomes one single equation: -3x-4y = 2\"\n",
      "\"(dividing by -2 is one step to simplify the expression);\"\n",
      "\"in this problem, the surprising fact is that the two given equations are actually identical\"\n",
      "\"In other words, we have one equation (-3x-4y = 2), and two unknowns (x and y);\"\n",
      "\"mathematically, such condition results in we have infinite number of solutions\"\n",

      "\"i.e., many pair of (x,y) can satisfy the given equation(s)\"\n",
      "\"Yes!\"\n",

      "\"Do you want to use substitution or elimination?\"\n",
      "\"elimination\"\n",
      "\"OK, the first thing to notice is that there is \"\"+2y\"\" in equation 1 and \"\"-4y\"\" in equation 2, agree?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"and did you notice that 2*2y - 4y = 0?\"\n",
      "\"ok.... You took the 2y-4y and came up with 2 and then took the 2y -4y and got the o\"\n",
      "\"or the 2 times 2 is four minus four\"\n",
      "\"yes, you sort of get the concept: we got the motivation to \"\"eliminate\"\" y by noting what we have;\"\n",
      "\"so, let's multiply 2 to both sides of equation 1 first (in order to have 2*2y = 4y)\"\n",
      "\"want to try this out on the board?\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"don't forget to multiply 2 to \"\"3x\"\" also\"\n",

      "\"oh yeah\"\n",
      "\"and the right hand side should be 4(2), right?\"\n",
      "\"yes!\"\n",
      "\"so then the 4 from the first line and the four from the second line would cancel out\"\n",

      "\"is that right\"\n",
      "\"x = 1 is correct. I see you try to use equation 2 to solve for y....keep going\"\n",
      "\"so would i multiply the 4y by 1\"\n",
      "\"um, not necessary. Let's just substitute known value of x (x=1) into equation 2 to solve for y. Makes sense?\"\n",
      "\"ok so it would be 5x(1x)-4y=3\"\n",
      "\"it is something like this:\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"since we know x = 1, we have:\"\n",
      "\"Makes sense? (just substitute x with 1)\"\n",

      "\"Cool, can you pick up fromhere and see what you get?\"\n",
      "\"ok i will try\"\n",
      "\"I can help if you need\"\n",
      "\"why you have +4y ?\"\n",
      "\"where does \"\"+4y\"\" come from?\"\n",
      "\"i have no idea i am used to adding or subtracting the y or x to eliminate the variable\"\n",
      "\"in this step, we just substitute the value of x into equation 2;\"\n",
      "\"now what do we do\"\n",
      "\"since x = 1 (we solved it), whenever we see an \"\"x\"\" in eq 2, we substitute it with 1\"\n",

      "\"alright\"\n",
      "\"The rule is:\"\n",
      "\"When we multiply two things with the same base...\"\n",

      "\"Hello I'm Kristen Welcome!\"\n",
      "\"How are you\"\n",
      "\"Hello Kristen. I got disconnected from last tutor.\"\n",
      "\"Oh i'm so sorry!\"\n",
      "\"I would like to show what I have so far.\"\n",
      "\"that would be perfect\"\n",
      "\"I'm looking for the value. I will show you how she was walking me through.\"\n",
      "\"ok great!\"\n",
      "\"actually she walked me through one that was similar. not this one exactly\"\n",
      "\"but I need 10\"\n",
      "\"I think you are having to do more steps than you need to .\"\n",
      "\"want me to help shorten it up a little bit?\"\n",
      "\"ok, but the videos say to find the value\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"ok so this part is perfect!\"\n",
      "\"we need to find 2 numbers that multiply to -200\"\n",
      "\"but add to 10\"\n",
      "\"sorry about that ... Our sever must be having some issues\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"I think what the other tutor was having you do is write out the 2 numbers that multiply to -200\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"as i'm writing them out I notice that 20 and 10\"\n",
      "\"one will add up to positive 10\"\n",
      "\"how did you do that\"\n",
      "\"ok great question\"\n",
      "\"oh yes the value of 200\"\n",
      "\"so what i did is I started with 1 or 2 and I just start dividing numbers into -200\"\n",
      "\"all the ones that work perfectly I write down\"\n",
      "\"i did one with a negative for each number since I knew one needed to be negative to get -200\"\n",
      "\"ok Im writing in my book\"\n",
      "\"is that ok?\"\n",
      "\"ok I'll wait let me know when you are set\"\n",
      "\"i'll get rid of the other stuff so we have more room\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"ok!\"\n",
      "\"so now we have the right 2 numbers that multiply to -200 and add to positive 10\"\n",
      "\"oh no?????\"\n",
      "\"what?\"\n",
      "\"do you know how to do the chart\"\n",
      "\"I know there is more than one way. but I don't see this at all\"\n",
      "\"there you go\"\n",
      "\"I'm not sure what the chart is doing but here is what you had\"\n",
      "\"sorry about that\"\n",
      "\"thanks. I'm calm now.\"\n",
      "\"ok no problem! I understand\"\n",
      "\"do you want me to keep going?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"so the 2's numbers that multiply to -200 and add to 10 are\"\n",
      "\"-10 and 20 the one I circles\"\n",
      "\"those 2 numbers go in place of the 10\"\n",
      "\"sorry, what does that have to do with the chart\"\n",
      "\"I don't understand the chart at all sorry... I've never seen that\"\n",
      "\"I was getting ready to show the factor by grouping part\"\n",
      "\"do you want me to end the session and see if someone can show you the chart\"\n",
      "\"ok some how the numbers are suppose to add up to get 10\"\n",
      "\"ok so .....\"\n",
      "\"we still keep the x with the 2 numbers\"\n",
      "\"doing great so far!\"\n",
      "\"you got it!\"\n",
      "\"sorry about the connection\"\n",
      "\"ok so you see how 5x +20 both have a 5 in common\"\n",
      "\"we need to take it out\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"the order doesn't matter but it looks nicer to have the 5 in front\"\n",
      "\"does it makes sense how i took the 5 out?\"\n",
      "\"let me check it with home work\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"it came out right.\"\n",
      "\"we don't have to do this one but just a question\"\n",
      "\"yeah no problem\"\n",
      "\"Im looking for -6x or a+b\"\n",
      "\"well first you want 2 numbers to multiply to 8\"\n",
      "\"and then add up to -6\"\n",
      "\"this one is -4x-2x\"\n",
      "\"you got it!!\"\n",
      "\"its the coefficient that is throwing me off.  multiplying it with c then finding the value. the value is my issue.\"\n",
      "\"the issue is finding the value\"\n",
      "\"oh i see\"\n",
      "\"think of it just as dividing\"\n",
      "\"so i do 8/1 = 8\"\n",
      "\"8/2=4\"\n",
      "\"8/3 is a decimal so i won't include it\"\n",
      "\"8/4 is a duplicate so i'm done since there is nothing else i can divide 8 both\"\n",
      "\"i now just look at my signs\"\n",
      "\"to be positive it has to either be both positive or both negative\"\n",
      "\"exactly!\"\n",
      "\"you saw it off the bat so you knew it was -2-4\"\n",
      "\"but in case it was a bigger number that is what i don\"\n",
      "\"yes, its crazy. I have to move past the bigger number fear\"\n",
      "\"I totally understand but you know what you are doing don't let it scare you\"\n",
      "\"ok thanks\"\n",
      "\"you are welcome sorry I couldn't help with the chart I've never seen that before\"\n",
      "\"but hopefully I was able to help with the other\"\n",
      "\"I hope you have a wonderful weekend\"\n",
      "\"LOL...oh yes, you helped.\"\n",

      "\"Perhaps I can help you solve this problem.\"\n",
      "\"Are you familiar with the system I am working with?\"\n",
      "\"What we usually do is to multiply the top and bottom by the 6 (denominator) raised to a power that will make it a whole number.\"\n",
      "\"I think I am familiar with what you are doing.\"\n",
      "\"I don't know how your online program presented it, but I can show you how I would answer it.\"\n",
      "\"Would that work for you?\"\n",
      "\"Ok..that's not what the computer wants. but let me see what you have.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, that would work.\"\n",
      "\"Are you familiar with fractional exponents?  I find it easier to explain with fractional exponents.\"\n",
      "\"Then we can convert back to radical notation.\"\n",
      "\"No.\"\n",
      "\"Then what would we multiply the 4th root of 6 by to get 6?\"\n",
      "\"Is that something you have learned?\"\n",
      "\"It has to be a radical using 6.\"\n",
      "\"no. see the drawing. I am familiar with\"\n",
      "\"This is not yet 6\"\n",
      "\"To get 6 we need the power under the radical to be 4 (the same as the root)\"\n",
      "\"ok....\"\n",
      "\"Does that start to make sense?\"\n",
      "\"How many factors of the 4th root of 6 do we need?\"\n",
      "\"no...I have a chart of perfect powers\"\n",
      "\"We can work with the idea and then use the chart.\"\n",
      "\"We need three more factors so we have 4 in total.\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"What power do we raise 6 to?  6 * 6 * 6 = 6^(?)\"\n",
      "\"yes, I was typing that. so that's the 216\"\n",
      "\"Right!  6 = 216\"\n",
      "\"And that is what we need.\"\n",
      "\"why that and not to the 4th power\"\n",
      "\"We could write it as the 4th root of 6 raised to the third power.....or the 4th root of 216.\"\n",
      "\"These say the same thing.\"\n",
      "\"Ohhh kaay\"\n",
      "\"See if that doesn't work for you.\"\n",
      "\"We also need to write the result.\"\n",
      "\"What would the result be?\"\n",
      "\"Let's write it out on the board correctly.\"\n",
      "\"oh I did not see the writings to the left side. Let me look at it.\"\n",
      "\"I didn't see you make any corrections.\"\n",
      "\"It would be better if you wrote it out and not me.\"\n",
      "\"I didn't know you were writing to the left.\"\n",
      "\"I took it away, because it is best if you write what you understand.\"\n",
      "\"I know that\"\n",
      "\"Can you make the corrections on the board?\"\n",
      "\"Or type them here, and I'll write it on the board.\"\n",
      "\"Want me to write it?\"\n",
      "\"I thought it was to written like this\"\n",
      "\"Looking good! . Keep going!\"\n",
      "\"We must multiply top and bottom by the same number.\"\n",
      "\"Otherwise we are changing the value of the fraction.\"\n",
      "\"Any number over itself  = 1\"\n",
      "\"Our objective is to \"\"rationalize the denominator\"\"\"\n",
      "\"The 4th root of 6 is an irrational number.\"\n",
      "\"When we multiply it by the 4th root of 6 (4th root of 216) we make the denominator 4th root of 6^4 = 6\"\n",
      "\"6 is a rational number.\"\n",
      "\"If we write this as powers, instead of big numbers, it may be easier to understand.\"\n",
      "\"Does the denominator of 6 make sense?\"\n",
      "\"You can't type in the chat area?\"\n",
      "\"You can type on the screen if that is easier than writing by hand.\"\n",
      "\"Let me just tell you how to do this then.\"\n",
      "\"The denominator is 6.  Are you okay with that step?\"\n",
      "\"We can multiply 3 x 216 = 648, but that does not explain how to simplify it.\"\n",
      "\"The system may simplify it.\"\n",
      "\"This fraction = 1\"\n",
      "\"We use it in this form in order to \"\"rationalize the denominator\"\"\"\n",
      "\"We are converting our fraction from one with an irrational denominator (4th root of 6) to a rational denominator (6).\"\n",
      "\"That is why the system shows this step.\"\n",
      "\"Does that answer the question?\"\n",
      "\"Note:  If you click the \"\"A\"\" at the bottom of your page, you may be able to type on the board.\"\n",
      "\"That may be faster than writing with a mouse.\"\n",
      "\"But the final answer will have some cancelling.\"\n",
      "\"If we factor 216 = 6 * 6 * 6\"\n",
      "\"And if we factor each 6 into 2 * 3 we can break it down further.\"\n",

      "\"I think you probably just made a simple arithmetic mistake.  325 divided by 0.21 will indeed give you the right answer, but it is not the answer you entered into the box on the screenshot.\"\n",
      "\"Are you using a calculator or working this by hand?\"\n",
      "\"calculator and a scietific\"\n",
      "\"Just try it again and check the decimal place on your answer, then tell me what you got.\"\n",
      "\"I know but I have tried 15.47 and 154.76 and it still will not move on\"\n",

      "\"Let me know if you do.\"\n",
      "\"yes that's what I get\"\n",
      "\"Okay, I think that is your answer.  HOWEVER, your teacher might be asking how many whole miles, without decimals, you can drive.\"\n",
      "\"Since 1547.62 is less than 1548, we cannot drive 1548 full miles.  We would only be able to drive 1547 full miles.  Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"so I will try this answer but it just looks like a lot of miles for the answer.  If it still isn't correct what can I do\"\n",
      "\"I am not sure exactly what your teacher is looking for there, but you did it right and just made a small arithmetic mistake.\"\n",
      "\"I think it is the right answer.  1547 miles is roughly the distance from, say, Texas to New York, so it isn't an absurd answer.\"\n",

      "\"yes.  i ttied to multipy both by that.  top and botton but my result box was red so I know that's not the answer\"\n",
      "\"Okay, so here's the issue\"\n",

      "\"2 means 2/1, right?\"\n",
      "\"the denominators are different, to add we should make them same.\"\n",
      "\"what should we multiply 1 by,to make it 2?\"\n",
      "\"2\"\n",

      "\"the first two questions give to you the information so when you put it there automatically answer the other section\"\n",

      "\"when you put 400 gallons automatically  answer that other part so i guess is 56 and 80  the answer but im stuck in the last ones\"\n",

      "\"So, going off that hint that's shown - let's try to do what it says\"\n",

      "\"So we have the expression, and also the depth of the water is given.\"\n",

      "\"So, you want to get x all by itself.\"\n",
      "\"The first thing we need to do is subtract 60 from both sides.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"If I subtract 60 from both sides, it gets rid of it from the left.\"\n",
      "\"Good! That's the right idea, but 25-60 is -35 not -45\"\n",
      "\"yeah right\"\n",
      "\"So, now you have 1/100 * x on the left.\"\n",
      "\"To get x all alone, you need to multiply both sides by -100\"\n",
      "\"That way, the fraction is gone.\"\n",
      "\"Good! But all the negative signs are gone now, too!\"\n",
      "\"why\"\n",
      "\"yeah i see it\"\n",
      "\"Yeah, because a negative * negative is positive, and that happens on both sides.\"\n",
      "\"So now you have x = 3500 gallons, which should be the answer to #3!\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"i already did\"\n",
      "\"So #4 is done the same way as #3, do you wanna go through it?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Ok no problem!\"\n",
      "\"i lost my equation\"\n",
      "\"I'll write it for you\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Alright, there we go\"\n",

      "\"I am doing okay I am just confused on a problem\"\n",
      "\"No worries!\"\n",
      "\"So when we have an inequality, we graph it like an equation -- the only differences are that we shade on one side of the line, and we might have a dashed line instead of a solid line... does that kind of sound familiar?\"\n",
      "\"I don't know what I am supposed to multiply to get the point of intersection on a graph\"\n",
      "\"yes I have that part figured out\"\n",
      "\"Well, to get the point of intersection, we can look at the line part of the inequalities -- so we can just treat it like two equations, and solve the system.\"\n",
      "\"Do you have a system of inequalities you'd like us to look at?\"\n",
      "\"2x+9>_18 I know the plot points are (-72,18) and (9,0)\"\n",
      "\"OK... is there a y there anywhere?\"\n",
      "\"7x+5y=35 The plot points are (-20,35) and (5,0)\"\n",
      "\"yes sorry its 9y\"\n",
      "\"No worries\"\n",
      "\"OK! So here, to find just the point where they intersect...\"\n",
      "\"we can look at them both as equations...\"\n",
      "\"and now we have a system of equations to solve  There are a couple methods we can use here, like elimination and substitution -- do either of those sound familiar at all?\"\n",
      "\"elimination is where i would get rid of either the x or y right?\"\n",
      "\"Right  So there, we'd want to multiply the equations so that the coefficents on one of the variables would match.\"\n",
      "\"that's where i am having difficult everything i choose to multiply by does not seem to work\"\n",
      "\"That's OK  Let's talk through it. What would you like to eliminate here -- x or y?\"\n",
      "\"y\"\n",
      "\"OK!\"\n",
      "\"So right now, we have 9y and 5y... what would be a common multiple of 9 and 5?\"\n",
      "\"45\"\n",
      "\"Good!\"\n",
      "\"So since 9x5 = 45...\"\n",
      "\"we want to multiply the top equation times 5...\"\n",
      "\"and the bottom equation times 9.\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense at all?\"\n",
      "\"yes it is starting to\"\n",
      "\"OK  Let's take a look at the top -- what do we get on the left side, with 5(2x + 9y)?\"\n",
      "\"I am not sure if i am supposed to multiply the 2x and 9y by 5\"\n",
      "\"Right, that's exactly what we want to do here\"\n",
      "\"so it would be 10x and 45y?\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"What will we get on the other side, with the 18 times 5?\"\n",
      "\"90\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"So now, we want to do the same thing in the other equation...\"\n",
      "\"just times 9 instead of 5\"\n",
      "\"63x+45y=315\"\n",
      "\"Awesome!\"\n",
      "\"So now, we want to subtract the two equations\"\n",
      "\"What do we get for 63x - 10x?\"\n",
      "\"53x\"\n",
      "\"good! How about for 45y - 45y?\"\n",
      "\"0\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"And how about 315-90?\"\n",
      "\"405\"\n",
      "\"Careful -- remember, we're subtracting\"\n",
      "\"oops225\"\n",
      "\"Good!\"\n",
      "\"So now, we know that 53x + 0 = 225  Can you use that to solve for x?\"\n",
      "\"combine 53x+0=53x and then divide both sides by 53\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"So this is definitely not the kind of answer you could get by looking at the graph  Do they want your answer as a fraction or a decimal?\"\n",
      "\"I think either way i put it in is okay because it will change to what they are looking for\"\n",
      "\"OK\"\n",
      "\"So now, we have x, right?\"\n",
      "\"yes 4.24528\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"So now, to solve for y...\"\n",
      "\"the common number would be 14\"\n",
      "\"Good!\"\n",
      "\"We could also plug 4.24528 into one of those equations, but using elimination again will actually be a little more precise because there won't be rounding\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"So to turn the 2x into 14x, what will we multiply that top equation times?\"\n",
      "\"multiply the top by 7\"\n",
      "\"Great! And how about the bottom equation?\"\n",
      "\"multiply by 2\"\n",
      "\"Good!\"\n",
      "\"So when we multiply the top equation, what will we get?\"\n",
      "\"14x+63y=126\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"14x+10y=70\"\n",
      "\"Terrific! What do you get when you subtract?\"\n",
      "\"53y=56\"\n",
      "\"Awesome! What does that make y equal?\"\n",
      "\"1.0566\"\n",
      "\"Nice work!\"\n",
      "\"Do you have any questions about how you worked this out?\"\n",
      "\"nope now i understand that when I need to multiply i need to first find the common number so i know what number to use\"\n",
      "\"Yep! A lot of the time you'll need to multiply both fractions, but that's totally OK\"\n",

      "\"hi, Welcome to Tutor.com! how's it going?\"\n",
      "\"good\"\n",
      "\"awesome, what can i help you with?\"\n",
      "\"I 'm struggling with all the math concepts,steps to solving equation\"\n",
      "\"so a linear equation like 3x+4=7 or something else?\"\n",
      "\"yes like that\"\n",
      "\"ok let me write that particular example on the board\"\n",
      "\"so the whole goal of these types is to isolate x, so we should do everything necessary to get the term with x by itself\"\n",
      "\"k\"\n",
      "\"so will it be like x.3+4=7?\"\n",
      "\"well i was talking about the steps to solve the equation, so in order to get the term with x (which is the 3x) by itself, we need to move the 4 to the other side\"\n",
      "\"we can do that by subtracting 4 from both sides (whatever we do to one side we have to do to the other to keep it balanced)\"\n",
      "\"did you follow how i did that?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"ok great. so once you have the term with x isolated the goal is to solve for x. if we want to get rid of the multiplication by 3, we can cancel it out by dividing by 3\"\n",
      "\"and of course whatever we do to one side we do to the other\"\n",
      "\"yes got it\"\n",
      "\"alright great. that is pretty much equation solving in a nutshell. isolate the term with x and then solve for x\"\n",
      "\"how about solving the equation 2n?\"\n",
      "\"2n= something?\"\n",
      "\"like 2n=4?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"it's a similar concept. 2 is multiplying by the n and we want to solve for n so to cancel the multiplication we have to divide\"\n",
      "\"how about calculating a fraction?\"\n",
      "\"like what do you mean?\"\n",
      "\"2/4+6/7=? do you always have to find a common denominator or it all depends on the problem-multiplication-addition etc....\"\n",
      "\"if you get lucky the denominators might be the same but yea generally you have to find the common denominator first before you can add/subtract\"\n",
      "\"so you just have to find the least common multiple of 4 and 7, which in this case is 28\"\n",
      "\"and then once you have the common denominator then you can add the numerators\"\n",
      "\"and reduce if necessary (they were both divisible by 2)\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"how about solving a linear inequality?\"\n",
      "\"it goes the same way as a linear equation except you just keep the inequality sign instead of an equals sign. the only other trick is that if you ever divide both sides of an equality by a negative, it flips the inequality, in the sense that < becomes >\"\n",
      "\"so the same process as solving linear equations really\"\n",
      "\"please correct me if wrong...solving for x example 2x=\"\n",
      "\"2x+7=6 2x=-1?\"\n",
      "\"that's exactly right, after subtracting 7 from both sides you get 2x=-1\"\n",
      "\"yeahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\"\n",
      "\"what would x be in that example if you solved for it?\"\n",
      "\"-1/2\"\n",
      "\"right, very nice\"\n",
      "\"sorry i disconnected for a moment\"\n",
      "\"the expression that is equivalent would be -7x=\"\n",
      "\"-7x+35\"\n",
      "\"the equivalent looks more like thi s  -7(x-5)\"\n",
      "\"right if you factor out a -7 that's exactly right. very nice\"\n",
      "\"cool\"\n",
      "\"when I get the question such as to solve an inequality..what's that means to me ?\"\n",
      "\"it means find the solutions. so like if you have 2x<4, you would solve it like a linear equation and divide both sides by 2 to get x<2\"\n",
      "\"so the solution is all the x values less than 2\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"10% of any amount is calculated as such: xample $20 x10 %100?\"\n",
      "\"10% means means 10/100 or 1/10 if you reduce it so yea 20 times 1/10 which would be 2\"\n",
      "\"unfortunately i am out of time for now but if you have more questions please feel free to log back in\"\n",
      "\"awwwww last question\"\n",
      "\"sure last question\"\n",
      "\"how do I calculate an extra mile if the first mile cost $2.20 and addtl $1.20\"\n",
      "\"first mile is 2.20 so you pay 2.20 no matter what, then 1.20x where x is each additional mile\"\n",
      "\"so how much you pay is 2.20+1.20x\"\n",
      "\"so if it is 12 miles more I will do 12x1.20?\"\n",
      "\"yea that would be right\"\n",
      "\"ok thank you so much for this time ..I truly appreciate it\"\n",
      "\"no problem, glad i could help. have a great night\"\n",
      "\"you too\"\n",
      "\"Hi! Welcome to Tutor.com. How are you doing?\"\n",
      "\"I am very confused in this class\"\n",
      "\"fine and you\"\n",
      "\"I'm having a good day, thanks! Let's take a look at what you're working on and see if we can get you less confused.\"\n",
      "\"I am going to write the question on the board\"\n",
      "\"OK!\"\n",
      "\"thank you\"\n",
      "\"OK! Do you have any ideas of how to start on this? It's totally OK if you're not sure!\"\n",
      "\"i know i have to remove () first\"\n",
      "\"Sounds good! Let's look at the left side.\"\n",
      "\"Doing great so far! Do you remember anything about multiplying fractions?\"\n",
      "\"lcd\"\n",
      "\"Remember, we have to multiply the 1/4 times both things in the parentheses\"\n",
      "\"Well, we need a LCD to add, but to multiply it's a little easier\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Remember, we can look at 3 as being the same thing as 3/1, right?\"\n",
      "\"show me please in steps\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"So we can look at this as being the same as 1/4 times 3/1...\"\n",
      "\"and because it's multiplication, we'll just multiply across the top and across the bottom.\"\n",
      "\"So on top, what do we get for 1 * 3?\"\n",
      "\"3\"\n",
      "\"bottom 4\"\n",
      "\"great!\"\n",
      "\"So 1/4 times 3 gives us 3/4\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense so far?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"So on the left side of our equation, we've got 1/4 x + 3/4\"\n",
      "\"why\"\n",
      "\"oh ii see\"\n",
      "\"OK?  So you did a good job with the distributive property there -- we multiplied everything in the parentheses times the 1/4 on the outside\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"So now, we want to use that distributive property on the other side --\"\n",
      "\"multiply the 1/2 outside the parentheses times everything inside the parentheses.\"\n",
      "\"What can we do to multiply the 1/2 times the 3x?\"\n",
      "\"not sure\"\n",
      "\"Well, remember, it's the same idea as what we did on the other side with the 1/4 and the 3...\"\n",
      "\"when we don't have a denominator, it's the same as having it over 1\"\n",
      "\"Looking good!\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"Good job! We can also write that 3x/2 as 3/2 x -- the fraction times x\"\n",
      "\"Good! What sign will we have with that 5/2 -- will we add it or subtract it?\"\n",
      "\"minus\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"So we have 1/4 x + 3/4 = 3/2 x - 5/2.\"\n",
      "\"Do you have any questions about this so far?\"\n",
      "\"no\"\n",
      "\"fractions are hard\"\n",
      "\"Well, there's a trick that will let us get rid of them\"\n",
      "\"help\"\n",
      "\"We have 4 and 2 in the denominators right now -- do you have any idea what a common denominator might be here?\"\n",
      "\"2\"\n",
      "\"can you rewrite expression on different page\"\n",
      "\"Careful -- you're on the right track, but remember, we want to find a number that we can divide by 2 with nothing left over, and divide by 4 with nothing left over\"\n",
      "\"Sure!\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"8\"\n",
      "\"That will work\"\n",
      "\"is the lcd\"\n",
      "\"So we can multiply everything here times 8, and not have any fractions to deal with anymore\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"show me please\"\n",
      "\"8 isn't exactly the lowest common denominator -- but it certainly is a common denominator\"\n",
      "\"4\"\n",
      "\"That works even better!\"\n",
      "\"So let's take a look at that left side.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"If we multiply the 1/4 on the 1/4x times 4, what will we get?\"\n",
      "\"1\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"How about 3/4 times 4?\"\n",
      "\"3\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"How about on the other side? What will we get for 4 times the 3/2 on the 3/2 x?\"\n",
      "\"6\"\n",
      "\"10\"\n",
      "\"Good!\"\n",
      "\"So we have 6x - 10 on the right side\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"So now, this should be looking much more manageable\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"so we always mulitiply\"\n",
      "\"fractions\"\n",
      "\"When we have fractions, multiplying by the LCD will make them go away\"\n",
      "\"great\"\n",
      "\"thank you\"\n",
      "\"We could have kept the fractions and done addition and subtraction with them, but that takes longer and it's easier to make a mistake along the way\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"multiplication is better\"\n",
      "\"thank you\"\n",
      "\"You're very welcome!\"\n",

      "\"Barbara: 200\"\n",

      "\"Good\"\n",
      "\"So when she started the summer, she probably had no money in the account\"\n",

      "\"Well, let's take an example\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"1 week;  1 times 25 = 25\"\n",
      "\"7 weeks:  7 times 25  = 175  which is what they said\"\n",

      "\"15 times 25 is?\"\n",
      "\"375\"\n",
      "\"That's right!\"\n",

      "\"Okay, I want to make sure that I understand your question correctly. Do you need help filling in the blanks that I will circle?\"\n",
      "\"I got the whole thing, but I was thinking this is the main part that you need help with. Is that right?\"\n",
      "\"the bounds and intervals\"\n",
      "\"yes the circled ones\"\n",
      "\"Great! Let's start with the bounds for the x-axis.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"The smallest x-value I see in your table is 0, so we should be able to leave that bound lower bound at 0.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"I also see that the largest x-value in your table is 1457.619, so we need to go up to something a little larger than that. Let's use 1500, since it's a nice round number.\"\n",
      "\"how do i figure out the bounds without guessing what do i look for?\"\n",
      "\"For the x-bounds, look at the column in your table that is the x-variable (also sometimes called the independent variable).\"\n",
      "\"This is almost always the first column that has numbers in it.\"\n",
      "\"ok the number would be 750 right\"\n",
      "\"We want a lower bound that is the same or slightly less than the smallest value in the x-column, and an upper bound that is the same or slightly larger than the largest number.\"\n",
      "\"Actually, 1547.619 is the largest number. I apologize, I had a typo earlier when I looked back and forth.\"\n",
      "\"so would that be 1600 to the right?\"\n",
      "\"Yes - good thinking :)\"\n",
      "\"ok thanks\"\n",
      "\"You're welcome! Now let's look at the interval for x. We will do the bounds and interval for y in a moment.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Looking at your x-values, there is not one correct interval... there are many that could work. In general, we don't want there to be too many lines on the axis because it gets too messy.\"\n",
      "\"So, since we need to go from 0 to 1600, I would suggest an interval of 100. That would only give us 16 lines.\"\n",
      "\"Does that part make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes it is a little confusing but i think i might have it it is all crazy to me\"\n",
      "\"I understand completely. It can be very tricky! Is there something that I can try to explain better, or are you ready to go on to look at the y boundaries and interval?\"\n",
      "\"no we can go on to the y intervals but if we go from 0 to 1600 how did you come up with 100?\"\n",
      "\"In general, we want an easy number... so values like 1, 5, 25, 50, 100, 200, etc.  are all often used. Since we needed to get from 0 to 1600, I thought the smaller values would be too small and give us too many lines.\"\n",
      "\"200 would also work, but then we would lose some detail there.\"\n",
      "\"So 100 is reasonable.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Like I said, there is not one right interval, so that makes it even a little trickier.\"\n",
      "\"Does that help at all?\"\n",
      "\"yes also can you explain the legend and enter label and equations: y= expression they totally have me lost on that\"\n",
      "\"Oh yes... we'll get to that after we do the y bounds and interval.\"\n",
      "\"ok thanks\"\n",
      "\"Now, the y-columns are the two columns to the right of the x-column.\"\n",
      "\"What is the smallest value in those two columns?\"\n",
      "\"525.00\"\n",
      "\"or do you mean 0.13x\"\n",
      "\"Yes! So we can use that for our lower bound, since it's a nice round number already.\"\n",
      "\"No. 525.00 is correct :)\"\n",
      "\"We just want to look at the values themselves, not the expression for this part.\"\n",
      "\"ok525\"\n",
      "\"Yes!\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"And now, what is the largest value in those two columns?\"\n",
      "\"585\"\n",
      "\"Hmmm, I see larger values than that. We don't need to look at only one line, but all of the values (except for the expressions).\"\n",
      "\"850.00\"\n",
      "\"Yes! Good!\"\n",
      "\"Since that is also a \"\"nice\"\" number, we can use that for the upper bound.\"\n",
      "\"Now to the interval. Do you have an idea of what a good interval might be here?\"\n",
      "\"630\"\n",
      "\"or maybe 650 is better\"\n",
      "\"The interval is the the value that is between lines in the graph. When we set the x-interval to 100, that meant that each line would go up 100 on the x-axis.\"\n",
      "\"If we start at 525 and add 650 to get to the next line, we would be way above our upper bound.\"\n",
      "\"I was thinking more like 25 would work.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Do you see why 650 is too big?\"\n",
      "\"yes because wouldn't it be to many lines?\"\n",
      "\"It would actually not be enough... there wouldn't even be 1 line between 525 and 850. By setting the interval to 25, we will have lines at 525, 550, 575, 600, ..., 800, 825, 850.\"\n",
      "\"The lines would be at every 25, starting from 525.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Does that help it make a little more sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes it does alot thanks you i feel pretty dumb but i have been out of math alot of years\"\n",
      "\"You are not dumb at all! It's not an easy thing to get. You are doing fine! :)\"\n",
      "\"thanks\"\n",
      "\"Let's finish with the legend and expressions part.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Since you are dealing with two different expressions here, we need to label them so we can tell which is which.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Let's label the first one Paenz, for the first company, and the second one opan for the second company\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Then, for the equations, simply type in the expression that goes with each one. So for Paenz, it would be 0.21x+525.00\"\n",
      "\"And for opan, it would be 0.13x+585.00\"\n",
      "\"Those are the expressions that go with each company.\"\n",
      "\"ok i understand now is the y interval on the top right 1\"\n",
      "\"Oh, I forgot to write that in. We decided that 25 would be a good value there, so that it goes 525, 550, 575, ...\"\n",

      "\"ok im trying to think of the formula fo rthis problem\"\n",
      "\"So for this one (just like differences of squares) it's all about identifying the \"\"a\"\" and \"\"b\"\", then you can basically just use this thing\"\n",
      "\"I know 27y is a perfect cube of 3y correct? and 8 is a perfect cube of 2\"\n",
      "\"yep! Exactly\"\n",
      "\"so is it (3y-2)(3y^2 +(3y2)+2^2)?\"\n",
      "\"Close  I think you mixed up the \"\"a\"\" and the \"\"b\"\"\"\n",

      "\"Are you there?\"\n",
      "\"hello\"\n",
      "\"Hi :)\"\n",

      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"Okay, great.  Now, since that passes through the vertex, it would have the same x value as the vertex, right? :)\"\n",
      "\"And our formula for that x value is x = -b/(2a), where a and b come from ax^2 + bx + c, the general quadratic form.\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense so far? :)\"\n",
      "\"not sure\"\n",
      "\"Okay, well looking at -5x^2 + 7x + 4, could you tell me what a and b are?\"\n",
      "\"Okay, close :)\"\n",
      "\"a is the number with x^2\"\n",
      "\"So a = -5\"\n",
      "\"b is the number with plain x, so b = 7 :)\"\n",
      "\"We never include an x in our a or b\"\n",

      "\"Well, x is left and right, y is up and down :)\"\n",
      "\"Like when we're graphing\"\n",

      "\"So if we add 9 there, can you tell what our g(x) would be? :)\"\n",
      "\"maybe 3\"\n",

      "\"So what would 3 + 9 leave?\"\n",

      "\"Right, very good.  So x^2 + 12 is our g(x) :)\"\n",

      "\"Right, so our vertex is at (-6, 0) :)\"\n",
      "\"Very good\"\n",
      "\"So now, if we were to move that 7 units to the right\"\n",
      "\"Can you tell what our new vertex would be?\"\n",

      "\"I'm alright\"\n",
      "\"I can write the problem on the board\"\n",
      "\"Okay\"\n",
      "\"I think I know what to do, I just wanna be sure\"\n",
      "\"So what did you think of doing next?\"\n",
      "\"Both the denominators are the same, and I'm wondering if I just subtract 3 from 5\"\n",
      "\"You got it!\"\n",
      "\"Exactly because the denominators are already the same, you can do the usual method of subtracting fractions\"\n",
      "\"If the denominators were different, you would have to get a common denominator first\"\n",
      "\"Your answer is correct here\"\n",
      "\"ok cool\"\n",
      "\"Did you have any other questions?\"\n",
      "\"actually yes\"\n",
      "\"how would I make the deno the same in this case?\"\n",
      "\"Just as a quick side example..\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"If the denominators were 2 & 5 you could get a common denominator as 2*5 = 10\"\n",
      "\"right\"\n",
      "\"If it were 2 & 4, a common denominator could be 2*4 = 8  (even though we know 4 is the LOWEST common denominator)\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Here, we don't know what \"\"x\"\" is so we can't find the LOWEST common denominator\"\n",
      "\"BUT we can get a guaranteed common denominator, if you just multiply the denominators by eachother\"\n",
      "\"Do you see what I mean?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Careful\"\n",
      "\"Remember when making common denominators you need to account for it in the numerators as well\"\n",
      "\"Based on what you had to multiply each fraction by to get the common denominator\"\n",
      "\"okay so my denos would go on top of each fraction as well?\"\n",
      "\"Well, not the full denominator\"\n",
      "\"If you look at the first term..\"\n",
      "\"To go from x/(3x-6) to the new term..\"\n",
      "\"What did you have to multiply by?\"\n",
      "\"You have to multiply the numerator AND denominator by that same number to get an equivalent fraction\"\n",
      "\"oh I see and I do the same with the other one but it's times 3x-6\"\n",
      "\"You got it!\"\n",
      "\"Since the second term already has the 8, you need only multiply by 3x-6\"\n",
      "\"So do you know how to fix up your numerators on the whiteboard now?\"\n",
      "\"is that an x or a multiplication sign?\"\n",
      "\"Multiplication\"\n",
      "\"You had to multiply the denominator by 8 to get the common denominator, so you do the same to the numerator\"\n",
      "\"Perfect, now that you have a common denominator, you can do the fraction addition and simplify\"\n",
      "\"Ah, careful!\"\n",
      "\"You can't cancel things out like that\"\n",
      "\"Those are in separate fractions\"\n",
      "\"If you do that now, it's like going backwards to what we started with\"\n",
      "\"You CHOSE to multiply by 3x-6 in order to get the common denominator, right?\"\n",
      "\"So you don't want to get rid of that, especially not before you combine the fractions\"\n",
      "\"Again, we need the 8 to be there so we have a common denominator\"\n",
      "\"(3x-6)*8 is our common denominator\"\n",
      "\"and as in the previous question, after getting a common denominator you can combine the numerators, right?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"So for the next line\"\n",
      "\"Just try to combine these into one fraction through fraction addition with a common denominator\"\n",
      "\"so after I perform the multiplication for the numerators, I can just add them straight across?\"\n",
      "\"Yep\"\n",
      "\"Again, that's because of the common denominator - we need to keep them the same\"\n",
      "\"You got it!\"\n",
      "\"Now, depending on your class you might either need to expand the denominator for the final answer or factor it completely for the final answer\"\n",
      "\"Or even this might suffice as the final answer\"\n",
      "\"Did the question say to simplify?\"\n",
      "\"I'll try it both ways and see what he says\"\n",
      "\"no it just says select the sum\"\n",
      "\"Oh, so it's multiple choice?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Does what we have so far appear as one of the choices?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"i can factor the bottom to see if that answer's on there too\"\n",
      "\"Actually, it might be easiest to start by expanding the denominator\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",

      "\"I can provide a simpler example that might make sense.  This part of inequalities is very tricky\"\n",
      "\"yes can try a simpler one please\"\n",
      "\"Ok great!  So we have 5 >= 4, which is a true statement\"\n",
      "\"If we multiply both sides by -1, then we have -5 >=-4.  Is this still a true statement?\"\n",
      "\"no its not a true statement\"\n",
      "\"Exactly, so when we multiply by a negative number, we must flip the inequality sign to make it a true statement!\"\n",
      "\"ohhh ok i see so we need to make the inequality true in order to solve the problem correctly\"\n",
      "\"Yes that's correct!\"\n",

      "\"Okay, I see that part, but I multiply 3 by 1-5\"\n",
      "\"Yep\"\n",
      "\"So we distribute the 3, that gives us the 3-15y part of it\"\n",
      "\"Then we just combine like terms (solving for y...)\"\n",
      "\"Okay\"\n",
      "\"now we divide?\"\n",
      "\"Yep\"\n",
      "\"that gives us our answer for y\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"Now, we use this answer to go figure out x\"\n",
      "\"We need x and y for the solution set\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"When we do this, we can use either equation to do it\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"Which one do you want to use?\"\n",
      "\"We will get same answer either way, going with 3x-2y = 6 or with 5x = 5-25y wont matter\"\n",
      "\"Both will be messy since y is a fraction :-/\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Let's just go with the first one, that may be less messy\"\n",
      "\"Okay, because I'm not sure lol\"\n",
      "\"It's okay, it would not matter either way\"\n",
      "\"I like which way might be easier\"\n",
      "\"This one might be easier, since the numbers are smaller... the 25 times the y in the last one scared me haha\"\n",
      "\"(25 times a fraction makes big numbers)\"\n",
      "\"ohh okay lol,\"\n",
      "\"So then -2 times this fraction, remember we multiply across the tops and bottoms\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"Now we need to combine like terms, which means subtracting this fraction and moving it to the other side\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"Next to combine these two numbers, we need a common denominator\"\n",
      "\"Any guess what common denominator we should use and how we get it?\"\n",
      "\"17?\"\n",
      "\"Yep\"\n",
      "\"I think we should multiply\"\n",
      "\"Right, we multiply the top and bottom by 17 to get 17 as the common denominator\"\n",
      "\"So what is 6 times 17?\"\n",
      "\"102\"\n",
      "\"Yep\"\n",
      "\"So then 102-6 ?\"\n",
      "\"96\"\n",
      "\"Yep\"\n",
      "\"Okay, so then last step\"\n",
      "\"Any guesses?\"\n",
      "\"divide?\"\n",
      "\"by 3\"\n",
      "\"Yep\"\n",
      "\"So, then we can either do 17 times 3 on the right side for a new denominator, or we can see if 96 and 3 cancel each other a bit\"\n",
      "\"ummm, lets do 17*3\"\n",
      "\"Okay\"\n",
      "\"(then we will have to reduce the fraction, which is more work)\"\n",
      "\"51\"\n",
      "\"okay so lets do it the other way\"\n",
      "\"So what is 96 divided by 3?\"\n",
      "\"32\"\n",
      "\"Right\"\n",
      "\"With the 96/51, if we divided both of those by 3 (in other words, reduced the fraction...)\"\n",
      "\"We also get 32/17\"\n",
      "\"right\"\n",
      "\"But it may be hard to see that if you multiply the 3 into the 17 first\"\n",
      "\"Anyway, we're done!\"\n",
      "\"We figured out x AND y, so that's it  We did it\"\n",
      "\"okay, I see\"\n",
      "\"Any other questions on how this one worked out?\"\n",
      "\"I have... I don't see that answer\"\n",

      "\"ok, now I think I see it\"\n",
      "\"So the factors he's looking for here are the (x - a) and (x - b)\"\n",

      "\"You would have just x^2 for the first term\"\n",
      "\"no ab??\"\n",
      "\"Not for the first term, I can show you the process\"\n",
      "\"please, I am desperate to understand\"\n",

      "\"ok, I think I see it\"\n",
      "\"It's like a long form of distributing\"\n",
      "\"got it\"\n",
      "\"Wonderful, so this would be the quadratic equation for any a or b, but it looks like he wants you to come up with this for a specific a and b of your choice\"\n",
      "\"right\"\n",
      "\"So you can pick some value for a and b and plug those in to finish this off, did you want to go through that part together? We can finish that if you want if you pick some number for a and for b\"\n",
      "\"that would be great\"\n",
      "\"any number , right\"\n",
      "\"so, for ease why not use 6 and 9? would that work\"\n",

      "\"Welcome to tutor.com! How can I help you? :)\"\n",
      "\"i am currently having a VERy  hard time with variables and pre algebra.. I am feeling lost and falling behind\"\n",
      "\"Alright! So, you mean something like this:\"\n",
      "\"yes but more along the lines of this one\"\n",
      "\"Okay.\"\n",
      "\"Well, when solving a problem like this, it's our goal to get all x's on one side of the =, and all other numbers on the other. So, our first goal would be to get rid of any parenthesis.\"\n",
      "\"got it....\"\n",
      "\"Now, do you have any practice problems you would like to work on, or would you prefer I offer some? :)\"\n",
      "\"um yes i do actually.\"\n",
      "\"Great! Why don't you write it out, we'll take a look at it. :D\"\n",
      "\"i am not sure what x is in this\"\n",
      "\"Well, is there an = in this problem? :)\"\n",
      "\"no it is asking to simplify the expression?\"\n",
      "\"Correct. When it asks for that, all you want to do is combine like terms. You're not trying to find x. :D\"\n",
      "\"i just realized that... i am slow as the grass grows.. lol\"\n",
      "\"You're fine. ;)\"\n",
      "\"So, to do that, we first want to distribute.\"\n",
      "\"ok... i am still a little slow with that\"\n",
      "\"Don't worry. :)\"\n",
      "\"So, 6(x-6).\"\n",
      "\"What does that become?\"\n",
      "\"6x?\"\n",
      "\"no just x?\"\n",
      "\"6x is part of it. :)\"\n",
      "\"That would be multiplying your 6 by the x. Now you need to multiply your 6 by the -6.\"\n",
      "\"  That is another part i am confused about... i do not recall multiplying neg's and positive's. i am so sorry for being so slow..\"\n",
      "\"lol\"\n",
      "\"Don't worry. I can explain that real quick. ;)\"\n",
      "\"When multiplying positives and negatives, all you need to remember is this:\"\n",
      "\"If both of your signs are the same, your answer will be positive. If they're different, your answer will be negative.\"\n",
      "\"For example:\"\n",
      "\"i understand!! i second guess my self WAY too much\"\n",
      "\"Well, we'll just help you build that self confidence. :D\"\n",
      "\"Yay\"\n",
      "\"So, back to our distribution. What's 6 times -6? :)\"\n",
      "\"-36\"\n",
      "\"Very good.\"\n",
      "\"Now, your second distribution.\"\n",
      "\"Remember, since you're subtracting here:\"\n",
      "\"You're multiplying the numbers inside by -4.\"\n",
      "\"20\"\n",
      "\"Well, 20 is the second half. What about -4 and x?\"\n",
      "\"4x\"\n",
      "\"-4x\"\n",
      "\"Correct. :D\"\n",
      "\"So, we've distributed our numbers.\"\n",
      "\"Next, we combine like terms.\"\n",
      "\"Whew...\"\n",
      "\"let's do it\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"Now, when combining like terms, we only combine the same type of numbers. So, we combine the x-numbers, and the non-x-numbers.\"\n",
      "\"So, 6x and -4x.\"\n",
      "\"What do you get when you combine them?\"\n",
      "\"10x\"\n",
      "\"-10x\"\n",
      "\"Both are good tries, but not quite. Remember, we're simply adding them here. So, what's 6+(-4)?\"\n",
      "\"Or, in other words, 6-4.\"\n",
      "\"2\"\n",
      "\"Right.\"\n",
      "\"So, you actually have 2x, not 10x.\"\n",
      "\"ohhhh i see because of the negative placement of the 4.... ok\"\n",
      "\"Correct. ;)\"\n",
      "\"Now. 2x+3x?\"\n",
      "\"5x?\"\n",
      "\"Very good. :D\"\n",
      "\"And 20-36?\"\n",
      "\"that is tricky\"\n",
      "\"lol\"\n",
      "\"Well, you know that the number you're subtracting is larger than 20, so your answer will be negative.\"\n",
      "\"right\"\n",
      "\"That being the case, let's subtract 20 from 36, and see what remains.\"\n",
      "\"So, what's 36-20?\"\n",
      "\"-16\"\n",
      "\"Very good. :)\"\n",
      "\"And that's your solution. :D\"\n",
      "\"Any questions on what we did?\"\n",
      "\"WOW... i forgot how much thoutht is involved.. i missed using this part of my brain but i do find myself not giving myself enough credit... that was challenging\"\n",
      "\"no you were great.. i am having issues with other things just too tired to think right now. lol\"\n",
      "\"I understand. :)\"\n",
      "\"Well, you can always feel free to reconnect whenever you'd like more practice. We're always around to help. :D\"\n",
      "\"And i love that you guys are here.. i will need you all the time.. everyday.. thank you alexander!!!\"\n",

      "\"Have a great evening!\"\n",
      "\"Hi....what can I help you with??\"\n",
      "\"Hi Trish I am having problems factoring......15x^2-14x-8\"\n",
      "\"It is not coming out right for some reason\"\n",
      "\"OK....we can work on that....let me put it on the board...is the equation equal to 0 or just factor the expression?\"\n",
      "\"just factor the expression\"\n",
      "\"OK....do you want to show me what you have tried or would you rather have me give you some tips on where to start?\"\n",
      "\"Well  I decided to use the ac method so I multiplied 15*-8 and got -120 so I factored it out to find what equaled -14\"\n",
      "\"and I got 6 and -20 which equaled -14\"\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\"so I rewrote the expression as 15x^2+6x-20x-8\"\n",
      "\"What if you try 15x^2 - 20x + 6x - 8\"\n",
      "\"So next I used grouping to get (15x^2+6x)(10x+4)\"\n",
      "\"Ohhh ok\"\n",
      "\"You can then factor out 5x(3x-4) + 2(2x-4)\"\n",
      "\"Sorry....2(3x-4)\"\n",
      "\"So (15x^2-20x)+(6x-8)\"\n",
      "\"ok one sec\"\n",
      "\"Yes....\"\n",
      "\"alright!!!!!! Thank you so much. So I have to be careful how I write the expression as far as the signs are concerned. Thank you that's all I needed. You want me to do a survey\"\n",
      "\"Yes....glad I could help.  Factoring is a lot of trial and error.  You are doing well, and it will get easier!\"\n",
      "\"I hope so...lol thanks have a good one\"\n",
      "\"You too!\"\n",
      "\"Welcome to Tutor.com!  Let's get started.\"\n",
      "\"hi there:)\"\n",
      "\"now this is two different problems right\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"ok for the first one\"\n",
      "\"do you have any idea how to begin:)\"\n",
      "\"are you trying to add 8 to both sides?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"we cannot just add the 8 to the 5 like that ok\"\n",
      "\"to add 8 to both sides\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"that cancels the 8 on the left ok\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"now what is -1 + 8\"\n",
      "\"7\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"now we are trying to solve for x\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"simp fraction\"\n",
      "\"now what should be  do next\"\n",
      "\"we have -5 times x  divided by 9\"\n",
      "\"so to get rid of the 9\"\n",
      "\"what would we do to both sides of the equation\"\n",
      "\"divided both side by 9\"\n",
      "\"not quite\"\n",
      "\"we need to do the opposite operation ok\"\n",
      "\"mupli\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"so we multiply both sides by 9\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"now 7 times 9 is\"\n",
      "\"do you follow so far\"\n",
      "\"so far\"\n",
      "\"now to get x by itself\"\n",
      "\"what do we do to both sides of the equation\"\n",
      "\"what to to do with that -5 divid or mupli\"\n",
      "\"we have -5 times x\"\n",
      "\"so we have to do the opposite operation\"\n",
      "\"add 5 to both sides\"\n",
      "\"not quite\"\n",
      "\"the opposite of multiplication\"\n",
      "\"is division ok\"\n",
      "\"so we would divide both sides by -5 ok\"\n",
      "\"now one more thing\"\n",
      "\"when we divide by a negative number\"\n",
      "\"we have to reverse the inequality ok\"\n",
      "\"give me the reason for that again I got that.\"\n",
      "\"because we are dividing by a negative number\"\n",
      "\"for instance -5  >  -8  but 5 < 8\"\n",
      "\"so whenever we divide or multiply by a negative number\"\n",
      "\"we must reverse the  inequality\"\n",
      "\"this is hard to understand\"\n",
      "\"this has to do with negative and positive numbers and the number line ok\"\n",
      "\"note  with negative number\"\n",
      "\"the greater the absolute value  the smaller the value\"\n",
      "\"-5  < -3\"\n",
      "\"with positive numbers, the greater the absolute value the greateer the value  8 > 6\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"when we divide by a negative  number\"\n",

      "\"so for your problelm\"\n",
      "\"we get\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"how  did you come up with that -12 *6??\"\n",

      "\"any questions on this\"\n",
      "\"no\"\n",
      "\"so lets try the next one ok\"\n",
      "\"now in this one we\"\n",
      "\"need to find x\"\n",
      "\"what do you think we should do first\"\n",
      "\"note we want to find x\"\n",
      "\"here we have 2 multiplied by x\"\n",
      "\"and then we add 7\"\n",
      "\"so if we want to find x - we have to get it by itself - and undo the operations done to it\"\n",
      "\"in the reverse order ok\"\n",
      "\"so what is the last thing we did\"\n",
      "\"subtract 7 from both sides\"\n",
      "\"very good\"\n",
      "\"since subtraction is the reverse of addition\"\n",

      "\"what is 6 - 7\"\n",
      "\"yes:)\"\n",

      "\"oooo\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"so this simplifies to\"\n",
      "\"very good:)\"\n",
      "\"any questions on this\"\n",
      "\"no thanks for your help  on the first one how do we know when we are done solving?\"\n",

      "\"yes, straight across so 5/2X5/3= 25/6\"\n",
      "\"good! So now it asks to rewrite that as a mixed fraction, do you have an idea how to do that?\"\n",
      "\"long division 25 divided by 6\"\n",
      "\"right\"\n",
      "\"I need to learn long division again, it's been years but I know it's simple to learn.\"\n",

      "\"*6 goes into 25\"\n",
      "\"4 times with 1 number left over\"\n",
      "\"right, so how do you think that will look as a mixed fraction?\"\n",
      "\"The answer shows 4 1/6 but why 1/6?\"\n",
      "\"so the number of times it goes into 25 is going to be your number in front.  The remainder is the numerator in the fraction portion of your answer, and the denominator always stays the same\"\n",
      "\"Oh I see, 6 stays the same because it's the deno and because there was 1 # left in how many times 6 goes into 25 that becomes the num\"\n",
      "\"yes, that's how you do it\"\n",

      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"the answer is correct, but how did you get that answer\"\n",
      "\"ok, let's do it step by step!\"\n",
      "\"So that tells us the speed at ANY time...\"\n",
      "\"all we do put the number of seconds in for T and we get the speed at that time\"\n",
      "\"so it's different depending on what time you ask\"\n",
      "\"so at 5 seconds we put 5 in place of T and get a number\"\n",
      "\"or at 8 seconds we put it in for T and get a number...\"\n",
      "\"so let's do that\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"see how we put 8 into our equation?\"\n",
      "\"now we can solve it\"\n",
      "\"Did you understand the steps?\"\n",
      "\"so i add the top numbers and multiply by 8\"\n",
      "\"right\"\n",
      "\"well you multiply by 8 here...\"\n",
      "\"and divide by 8 here\"\n",
      "\"so where did the 50.4 come from\"\n",

      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"that's the problem\"\n",

      "\"so we need to replace T with 8 seconds\"\n",
      "\"or just 8\"\n",
      "\"we have two T's in the formula\"\n",
      "\"so we put an 8 in place of each of them\"\n",

      "\"Do you like to try this step?\"\n",
      "\"Sure ...\"\n",
      "\"We are multipling -right?\"\n",
      "\"Perfect\"\n",
      "\"You are exactly right\"\n",
      "\"Very close.\"\n",
      "\"square root of 6 *square root of 6 = square root of 36\"\n",
      "\"As both are radical.\"\n",
      "\"But square root of 6 * 3 is not equal to square root of 18.\"\n",
      "\"I see ..\"\n",
      "\"As 3 is not radical.\"\n",
      "\"So 3* square root of 6= 3square root of 6 only\"\n",
      "\"Yes, got it ..\"\n",

      "\"Okay\"\n",
      "\"I'm not sure I really understood the root of 3 / 6 ?\"\n",
      "\"Let me explain it to you again.\"\n",
      "\"Here both the 6 are inside the radical\"\n",
      "\"Sorry, a little complicated..\"\n",
      "\"So it would be square root of 36.\"\n",

      "\"3 is not inside of radical\"\n",

      "\"Can you guess what will be the next step?\"\n",
      "\"Sometimes it helps hearing them again to assure it wasas told..\"\n",
      "\"Okay\"\n",
      "\"What will you do next ?\"\n",
      "\"Divide 6 into 36\"\n",
      "\"Almost correct.\"\n",
      "\"Can you further simplify square root of 6?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, divide by 2 = 3\"\n",
      "\"Can you further simplify square root of 36*?\"\n",
      "\"Sorry about the typo.\"\n",
      "\"So square root of 36=?\"\n",
      "\"Yes = it would = 6\"\n",

      "\"No, not really.  It is just sometimes hard to figure out how to translate the process when writing.\"\n",
      "\"Okay\"\n",
      "\"Next step is to combine the like terms.\"\n",
      "\"What are the like terms here?\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"So, to combine like terms, we have 6/6 right\"\n",
      "\"Very good\"\n",
      "\"So 3 sqrt 6+ 6 sqrt 6=?\"\n",
      "\"=1918\"\n",
      "\"oops /... = 18\"\n",
      "\"Very close\"\n",
      "\"We need to add here.\"\n",

      "\"Hi, welcome to Tutor.com!\"\n",
      "\"hello\"\n",
      "\"What can I help you with?\"\n",
      "\"system of equations, what can conclude...\"\n",
      "\"Okay, do you know how to begin at all?\"\n",
      "\"not really\"\n",
      "\"all the steps and problems we have been working on this week are running together\"\n",
      "\"Okay, you've probably heard of something called slope-intercept form, or y=mx+b\"\n",
      "\"does that sound familiar?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"y=mx+b\"\n",
      "\"Great, so a good way to start here would be to change these equations to both be in that form- then we will see how they are related more clearly\"\n",
      "\"do you know how to write these equations in that form?\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"the fist one is right?\"\n",
      "\"Right, so just the second\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"So how could you rewrite that second equation?\"\n",
      "\"this is probably easier than I am trying to make it\"\n",
      "\"Could be... what do you need to get rid of on the left side to get y alone?\"\n",
      "\"2x\"\n",
      "\"-2x\"\n",
      "\"Right, so to get rid of that, we do the opposite operation- so since 2x is being subtracted, we add 2x to each side to move it over\"\n",
      "\"so now just y is on the left, and what is on the right?\"\n",
      "\"11x\"\n",
      "\"We can't actually combine the 9 and 2x\"\n",
      "\"They are not \"\"like terms\"\" since only one has an x\"\n",
      "\"so we leave it as 2x+9\"\n",
      "\"i knew that they are differnet\"\n",
      "\"Right, so that is as simplified as it gets\"\n",
      "\"and now we have 2 equations in the same form- can you see what is the same and what is different about these lines?\"\n",
      "\"so they are inconsistent?\"\n",
      "\"one is -9 other is +9\"\n",
      "\"Well they are parallel lines, so yes, nice job!\"\n",
      "\"ok. i have one more like this\"\n",
      "\"Great, here is another screen\"\n",
      "\"Okay, we can do this one the same way- changing them to slope-intercept form so we can compare\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"my answer choices are no solution, (0,-1), (-1,0), infineit\"\n",
      "\"Okay, so how can we get y alone in the first equation?\"\n",
      "\"add? -4x\"\n",
      "\"Nice job, we just have to keep that - before the 6y\"\n",
      "\"Right, now we divide by -6\"\n",
      "\"?\"\n",
      "\"You are right that just y is on the left\"\n",
      "\"on the right side, we divide both of those terms by 6\"\n",
      "\"sorry, -6\"\n",
      "\"I switched the order just so it's the form y=mx+b- do you see how that worked so far?\"\n",
      "\"those are both negatives because we had 4 and 4x divided by -6\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Is that part clear now?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Great, so the last thing to do is reduce the fractions- do you know what 4/6 reduces to?\"\n",
      "\"Perfect, and again we need to remember those negatives\"\n",
      "\"gosh right\"\n",
      "\"So there we have our first equation- is it all clear?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Wonderful, and now we can do the same for the second equation\"\n",
      "\"so what will that one look like?\"\n",
      "\"brb\"\n",
      "\"Okay\"\n",
      "\"ok back sorry\"\n",
      "\"Not a problem- so we were going to write the second equation in the same form as the first\"\n",
      "\"do you see how to get y alone here?\"\n",

      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"72\"\n",
      "\"Correct !!\"\n",
      "\"4 18\"\n",

      "\"yeah\"\n",
      "\"i have that already b\"\n",
      "\"already *\"\n",
      "\"Okay so now what can be taken out common from the 1st term?\"\n",
      "\"So 9x we can take out as common Did you get how we did that?\"\n",
      "\"yeah\"\n",

      "\"close lets see what you missed.\"\n",

      "\"See what we do is we write the prime factors of the numbers and then we take out what is common.\"\n",
      "\"like 4=2*2 and 8=2*2*2 so commone is 2*2 i.e. 4.\"\n",
      "\"what are the -1 mean ?\"\n",
      "\"okay see we have a -1 with 4 and not with 8\"\n",
      "\"so i can write -4 as 4* -1?\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"And i can write 8 as 8*-1*-1 ?\"\n",
      "\"and why -4 and not -8\"\n",
      "\"we have -4 in the expression and +8\"\n",
      "\"Are you able to follow?\"\n",
      "\"yeah\"\n",
      "\"So does it make sense to you why we get -4 as common?\"\n",

      "\"we should start on the inside with the 786\"\n",

      "\"yes i think the 3?? and the 131\"\n",

      "\"but since there are no groups of 4 amont\"\n",
      "\"2 times 3 times 131\"\n",
      "\"we leave 786 alone\"\n",
      "\"next, let's consider the 4th root of x^2\"\n",
      "\"will we be able to factor anything out here? (and remember, we're looking for groups of 4)\"\n",
      "\"i wanna say x\"\n",
      "\"Ah, so x^2 becomes:\"\n",
      "\"x times x\"\n",
      "\"since the radicand is 4\"\n",
      "\"that is, since we're taking the 4th root\"\n",
      "\"we only have a pair of x's\"\n",
      "\"not a set of 4\"\n",
      "\"ok i think im getting it\"\n",
      "\"so we're actually not able to pull any x's out front either\"\n",
      "\"check out the y's\"\n",
      "\"we have y^7\"\n",
      "\"which we could write as:\"\n",
      "\"y times y times y times y times y times y times y\"\n",
      "\"again, since the radicand is 4, we're looking for groups of 4\"\n",
      "\"there is a group of 4!\"\n",
      "\"yeah one\"\n",
      "\"so we can cancel them out and write y in front of the radical\"\n",
      "\"exactly right\"\n",
      "\"just 1 gets written out front\"\n",
      "\"so that leaves:\"\n",
      "\"that as our final answer--note how we were only able to pull a y out front\"\n",
      "\"even though it might seem like we can pull more out front\"\n",
      "\"just a y can go out front!\"\n",

      "\"the domain is the set of all possible values of x we can put into the function\"\n",
      "\"and the range is the set of all possible values of the function itself\"\n",
      "\"ok, i understand\"\n",
      "\"Now, let me show you an example\"\n",
      "\"Done.\"\n",
      "\"Can you see it?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"the domain of the function shown in the graph is: x >= -4\"\n",
      "\"or [-4, oo) in interval notation\"\n",
      "\"And the range of the function is y >= 0 or [0, oo) in interval notation\"\n",
      "\"I have a question\"\n",
      "\"Ok, what is it?\"\n",
      "\"will the domain always be found on the x axis where the point is located?\"\n",
      "\"It will be found on the x-axis but it is not necessary the graph to touch the x-axis\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"I pasted a new graph, can you see it?\"\n",
      "\"i see it\"\n",
      "\"alternatively, the graph can cross the x-axis several times\"\n",
      "\"The domain of the function of the last graph I pasted is: all real numbers or (-8, 8)\"\n",
      "\"And its range is -1 <= y <= 1 or [-1,1] in interval notation\"\n",
      "\"I'm working on this...\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Is it more clear now?\"\n",
      "\"a little\"\n",
      "\"Can we go back to the third graph because it resembles more of what we were doing in class\"\n",
      "\"The graph with domain x >= 2 and range y >=3?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Ok, I'm looking at it\"\n",
      "\"ok, of course the graph would not have the text in the green or red, so if I was just looking at the blue line and was ask to find the domain and the range how would I do that?\"\n",
      "\"to find the domain we should make a horizontal analysis (because the domain is located on the x-axis)\"\n",
      "\"WE should note that the graph starts at x = 2 (full dot) and it goes to the right to infinity\"\n",
      "\"does it make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"how do we represent that the domain is all the numbers from 2 (inclusive) to infinity?\"\n",
      "\"We can use the inequality notation:\"\n",
      "\"x >= 2\"\n",
      "\"Or the interval notation:\"\n",
      "\"[2, infinity)\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"does it make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"We use the same logic to find the Range of the function but it would be a vertical analysis and it lies on the y-axis\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"The range is like the vertical scope of the function\"\n",
      "\"it goes from the value of y = 3 up to infinity\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"is it more clear for you now?\"\n",
      "\"A lot more clear\"\n",
      "\"what if I give you a graph and you tell me what its domain and range is?\"\n",
      "\"ok, I would like to try that\"\n",
      "\"Done. I pasted on board #2\"\n",
      "\"Can you see it?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"So... what is the domain of the function shown in the graph?\"\n",
      "\"is it 3?\"\n",
      "\"wait\"\n",
      "\"x>=3\"\n",
      "\"x >= 3 would be right if the direction of the graph was to the right but it is to the left\"\n",
      "\"because the graph is located to the left of x = 3\"\n",
      "\"wow, ok I understand, so would it be x<=3\"\n",
      "\"yes, it would\"\n",
      "\"great!\"\n",
      "\"How about its Range?\"\n",
      "\"ok, I know the point is 1.7 but does the same concept apply that the graph is going to the left?\"\n",
      "\"Note: For the range we have to look at the y-axis not the x-axis\"\n",
      "\"And yes the graph intercepts the y-axis about 1.7 but it is not the only possible value for y\"\n",
      "\"ok so 1.7>=x?\"\n",
      "\"No, the range has nothing to do with x\"\n",
      "\"For the range we should forget about the x-axis\"\n",
      "\"oh I am so used to putting that as a variable I am sorry\"\n",
      "\"Note tha the graph starts from 0 and it goes up to infinity\"\n",
      "\"that*\"\n",
      "\"ok, so y>=1.7?\"\n",
      "\"No, it is y >= 0\"\n",
      "\"because it doesn't start at y = 1.7\"\n",
      "\"it comes from y = 0\"\n",
      "\"ok I do understand that\"\n",
      "\"Important note: For the domain we just look at the x-axis (and we forget about the y-axis) and for the domain we just look at the y-axis (and we forget about the x-axis)\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Do you want to give a try with another graph?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Give me a minute\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Done.\"\n",
      "\"Can you see it?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"SO... the domain of the shown function is:\"\n",
      "\"Take your time\"\n",
      "\"x<=1?\"\n",
      "\"COrrecr\"\n",
      "\"Correct*\"\n",
      "\"yay!!!\"\n",
      "\"NIcely done\"\n",
      "\"How about its Range?\"\n",
      "\"Hint: forget about the x-axis\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Take your time.\"\n",
      "\"y>=0?\"\n",
      "\"No, it is not\"\n",
      "\"ok can I try once more\"\n",
      "\"Yes, you can\"\n",
      "\"y<=0?\"\n",
      "\"That would be right if the function only went up to y = 0 but it goes up to y =2\"\n",
      "\"ok i understand\"\n",
      "\"So... the range is _____\"\n",
      "\"y<=2?\"\n",

      "\"Welcome to Tutor.com!  Let's get started.\"\n",
      "\"Hello!\"\n",
      "\"HI i am getting confused with these negative exponents\"\n",
      "\"Alright, did you have a problem you wanted to look at?\"\n",
      "\"OK, do you have an idea how to start?\"\n",
      "\"well i chose the option to get rid of the negative exponents and simplify but i somehow did it incorrectly\"\n",
      "\"OK, the 1/4 that you have is right, but how did you get rid of the negative in front of the 9?\"\n",
      "\"well they said to put 1 over it but i thought since i divided it would automatically get rid of it\"\n",
      "\"Well, that's a good thought, but actually we have to be a bit more careful about that.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"still have to put it in the denominator of the bottom:\"\n",
      "\"That's how we would get rid of the negative exponent; does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"i think so\"\n",
      "\"OK, and then we can simplify that more.\"\n",
      "\"Do you know how we divide by a fraction?\"\n",
      "\"dont you multiply it by flipping it\"\n",
      "\"Yep, that's right!\"\n",
      "\"So what do you get if you try that?\"\n",
      "\"what are we multiplying here\"\n",
      "\"Well, it is the numerator of the original fraction, which is 1 here, and the reciprocal of the denominator.\"\n",
      "\"So what is the reciprocal of 4/j^9?\"\n",
      "\"ok now i am confused again\"\n",
      "\"Well, can you find the reciprocal of 4/j^9?\"\n",
      "\"it would be just the opposite right?\"\n",
      "\"Right.\"\n",
      "\"That's close!\"\n",
      "\"But it is only 4/j^9 that we are changing.\"\n",
      "\"The reciprocal of 4/j^9 is j^9/4.\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"i think so\"\n",
      "\"OK, and then what do you get when you multiply?\"\n",
      "\"Excellent!\"\n",
      "\"So that's the final answer for this one.\"\n",
      "\"Do you have any questions about that?\"\n",
      "\"i think i need to do another one to see how it works again\"\n",
      "\"OK, did you have one?\"\n",
      "\"yup\"\n",
      "\"Alright, do you have an idea how to start?\"\n",
      "\"we have to divide by 1?\"\n",
      "\"or put i over it?\"\n",
      "\"1 over it\"\n",
      "\"Yes, we put 1 over it with a positive exponent now.\"\n",
      "\"OK, that's close!\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"But the exponent of -5 was not on the -4, right?\"\n",
      "\"ummm\"\n",
      "\"It's only on the z.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"that means that we only put the z^5 in the denominator, not the -4.\"\n",
      "\"There you go!\"\n",
      "\"good work\"\n",
      "\"Do you have any questions on that one?\"\n",
      "\"no i think i am getting it a little better can we do another one\"\n",
      "\"Sure!\"\n",
      "\"OK, this is like the first one.\"\n",
      "\"i think i already forgot how we did that one\"\n",
      "\"OK, well, we do the -2x^-5 like we just did for the previous problem.\"\n",
      "\"(like the -4z^-5).\"\n",
      "\"so what does -2x^-5 become if you get rid of the negative exponent?\"\n",
      "\"it just becomes -2x^5 right?\"\n",
      "\"Well, we have to put the x^5 in the denominator of the -2:\"\n",
      "\"Just like the -4z^-5 became -4/z^5.\"\n",
      "\"okay but then what about the -19\"\n",
      "\"Well, I'm not sure what you are thinking, but the next step would be to multiply by the reciprocal of the -2/x^5.\"\n",
      "\"i totally forgot what we did on the first one\"\n",
      "\"oh right ok\"\n",
      "\"OK, but it is the -19 that we are multiplying by that:\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"i understand how you are doing it..but my brain is not exactly processing it completely\"\n",
      "\"so when we multiply the -19 by the x^5/-2 then we get -19x^5/-2?\"\n",
      "\"Right!\"\n",
      "\"And then can you cancel anything?\"\n",
      "\"i dont think so\"\n",
      "\"Well, what is the sign of a negative divided by a negative?\"\n",
      "\"oh right so its positive\"\n",
      "\"Good!\"\n",
      "\"So we can cancel the negative signs.\"\n",
      "\"right\"\n",
      "\"so this one now...\"\n",
      "\"Perfect!\"\n",
      "\"So does that take care of your questions?\"\n",

      "\"does this make sense ?\"\n",

      "\"Welcome to Tutor.com! How can I help you today?\"\n",
      "\"let me get the screen shot for you. hang on\"\n",
      "\"Not a problem, sounds good\"\n",
      "\"File Shared > carnegie.docx\"\n",
      "\"I'm stuck again\"\n",
      "\"  Alright, coming up with the expression, I see?\"\n",
      "\"So, what would you like to do - the purely algebraic way, or the \"\"real world interpretation\"\" way?\"\n",
      "\"um...algebraic way\"\n",
      "\"I guess\"\n",
      "\"The dog problem was the \"\"real world\"\" way, the algebraic would be finding two points, computing their slope, then computing the y-intercept, b\"\n",
      "\"I've done some things with guessing, but I don't know where goes where\"\n",
      "\"Sure, I get that\"\n",
      "\"So if we're just going with algebra, we've got to pick out two \"\"points\"\" (pairs of numbers) given the words\"\n",
      "\"They say \"\"2 hours in, the temp is -17\"\" turns into the point (2, -17)\"\n",
      "\"ok.\"\n",
      "\"so then I subtract them>?\"\n",
      "\"Now we'll use the slope formula, to find m. (Again, we're looking for an \"\"mx + b\"\" expression)\"\n",
      "\"In a sense, yeah\"\n",
      "\"yes, but to get there we have to do the m= expression\"\n",
      "\"Right, exactly\"\n",
      "\"ok, that's what is getting me all messed up.\"\n",
      "\"Sure, I get that. That's why I'm a fan of the \"\"real world way\"\", where we know that \"\"m\"\" has to represent the change in temperature each hour\"\n",
      "\"i.e., how much the temperature drops each hour (and that it's dropping tells us that the slope, m, will be negative)\"\n",
      "\"17-2/-47-8\"\n",
      "\"You're mixing x's and y's. The top should be y's only, and the bottom should be x's only\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"(change in y, over change in x)\"\n",
      "\"So the top is -47 - (-17)\"\n",
      "\"oh.\"\n",
      "\"And if that's the top, then the bottom is 8 - 2\"\n",
      "\"-30/6=-5\"\n",
      "\"Perfect. That means that the temperature is dropping 5 degrees every hour\"\n",
      "\"yes, that's what I got when I was guessing through it.\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"OK, that's awesome then!\"\n",
      "\"So now we just need to find the \"\"b\"\", which is the starting temperature. We have two ways:\"\n",
      "\"i came up with -10 for b\"\n",
      "\"That looks a little off\"\n",
      "\"oh. the y1 and x1\"\n",
      "\"Yep, we use two points, and the slope, to help us find b\"\n",
      "\"So that's the \"\"real world\"\" explanation of what the algebra on the left represents\"\n",
      "\"yes, -5*2=-10\"\n",
      "\"You do the exact same work either way, I just find that I don't need to memorize anything if I think about it in terms of the left!\"\n",
      "\"why did you put -10 in for x?\"\n",
      "\"You just told me that -5*2 = -10\"\n",
      "\"So I replace -5(2) with -10\"\n",
      "\"yes, but i thought that was for b>\"\n",
      "\"The -10 is how much the temperature *changed* over the first two hours\"\n",
      "\"And if, 2 hours in, it was -17, then it must have been 10 degrees warmer 2 hours before\"\n",
      "\"So at 0 hours in, the temperature would have been -17 + 10, or -7. Just like the algebra says\"\n",
      "\"then we put -7 in the equation of y=mx+b\"\n",
      "\"Exactly\"\n",
      "\"on the b side,\"\n",
      "\"It started at -7 degrees, and dropped 5 degrees each hour: -5x - 7\"\n",
      "\"ok, can you hang on>?\"\n",
      "\"So that's the expression you want for the temperature. Again, very nice job\"\n",
      "\"Sure, absolutely\"\n",
      "\"ok, i finished that question. can we do the next one, with me answering and guiding the way to see if I've got it>\"\n",
      "\"Sure, I have time for one more\"\n",
      "\"thank you\"\n",

      "\"lol, hang on. i'\"\n",
      "\"m\"\n",
      "\"Ah, same problem?\"\n",
      "\"trying to rush\"\n",
      "\"Oh, that's OK, the other one really didn't take that long, trust me!\"\n",
      "\"Er, I think I did get the updated one, hang on\"\n",
      "\"starts with maria?\"\n",
      "\"Yep, got it, copying now\"\n",
      "\"ok, I've got the first three boxes on the left filled out and two on the right\"\n",
      "\"OK, and I imagine that you're using \"\"x\"\" as the number of hours after opening?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Alright, so it's just a matter of coming up with an \"\"mx + b\"\" expression for the amount of money they've got, after x hours\"\n",
      "\"yes.\"\n",
      "\"m-20\"\n",
      "\"m=20\"\n",
      "\"Close, the \"\"b\"\" is the starting value, \"\"m\"\" is how much money they're taking in each hour\"\n",
      "\"oh, yea\"\n",
      "\"And actually, they _invested_ 20 dollars, which means they're starting the day 20 dollars in the red; with -20 dollars, I would say\"\n",
      "\"and that's what we have to do the other expression to find out, right>\"\n",
      "\"Yeah, once we know that b = -20, we just need to find m. Again, \"\"m\"\" here represents the amount of money they're making each hour\"\n",
      "\"-20+24\"\n",
      "\"?\"\n",
      "\"so it would be 4x?\"\n",
      "\"Normally, I'd agree. But I think this problem is weird; they're mixing profit and revenue, so it's kind of an oddball question. Here's how I'm interpreting it:\"\n",
      "\"this is the kind of questions i get all the time, weird ones\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"I think when they say \"\"They collected $24, after 4 hours\"\" that means that we're ignoring the 20 dollar investment, and just assuming that they took in $24, in 4 hours\"\n",
      "\"So we need to know how much they took in per hour\"\n",
      "\"So, if they \"\"collected $24 in 4 hours\"\"...\"\n",
      "\"What's the ratio we want?\"\n",
      "\"24/4?\"\n",
      "\"Exactly!\"\n",
      "\"wow\"\n",
      "\"so now we have y=6x+(-20)\"\n",
      "\"Yep, that's exactly right\"\n",
      "\"so then we have to find out y>?\"\n",
      "\"Well, this is what tells us the y: After being open for x hours, they'll have a profit of 6x - 20 dollars\"\n",
      "\"So maybe I'm not sure what you're asking, if that didn't clear it up\"\n",
      "\"i just thogh there was another step\"\n",
      "\"Ah, nope, that's it: We found b, and we found m. As far as the expression is concerned, we're done\"\n",
      "\"ok. i think i got it from here.\"\n",
      "\"let me see\"\n",
      "\"Alright, no problem. Let me know if you run into trouble, or if it accepts everything\"\n",
      "\"ok.\"\n",
      "\"what's even? 0?\"\n",
      "\"Yeah, it's when they profit 0 dollars\"\n",
      "\"I'm working on this...\"\n",
      "\"(sorry about that, auto-response!)\"\n",
      "\"Any luck?\"\n",
      "\"yes,\"\n",

      "\"instead of 6\"\n",
      "\"Oh, for... question 3?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"and 2, it's just strange that you have to do that.\"\n",
      "\"Well, if they'd only been open 6 hours, their total profit would be 36 - 20 = 16 dollars, so not quite 10 a piece\"\n",

      "\"Can you explain slope and y-intercept? Is there a formula to figure these equations out?\"\n",
      "\"sure\"\n",
      "\"there are several formulas that are used with slope and y intercept\"\n",
      "\"the most basic one is y = mx + b where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y intercept\"\n",
      "\"let me give an example\"\n",
      "\"so 'm' or slope is how steep the tilt of the line is\"\n",
      "\"and 'b' is where the line crosses the y axis\"\n",

      "\"we usually start a graph by putting the y intercept on\"\n",
      "\"what would 'b' be for this equation?\"\n",
      "\"would it be 2x?\"\n",

      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"okay, does it make sense that for this equation b = 1?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"okay, then we look at the y axis, the vertical axis\"\n",
      "\"and we find +1\"\n",
      "\"and we know the line goes through that point\"\n",
      "\"okay so far?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"okay, then the way we use the slope, or 'm'\"\n",
      "\"'m' is the number in front of the x term\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"and it's usually helpful to write 'm' as a fraction\"\n",
      "\"so we just put a 1 under the 2\"\n",
      "\"and then the top of the fraction is the change in 'y'\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"and the bottom is the change in 'x'\"\n",
      "\"or rise over run\"\n",
      "\"so to find another point on the line\"\n",
      "\"since the slope is positive, we go 2 in a positive y direction and 1 in a positive x direction\"\n",
      "\"and that's another point on the graph of the line\"\n",
      "\"and we can do that for several more points if we want\"\n",
      "\"and if we draw a line through the points, then we have 'graphed' the line\"\n",

      "\"I think so. What you're saying is \"\"m\"\" is the slope and \"\"1\"\" is the y, and the first point on the graph is the slope?\"\n",
      "\"okay, almost... the first point on the graph is the 'b', or the y intercept\"\n",
      "\"and the reason it's called \"\"y intercept\"\" is because that is where the line crosses the y axis\"\n",

      "\"Okay I think I see\"\n",
      "\"So the 7800 you got from estimating on the graph, right?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"So since the vertex is around there, you said 7800\"\n",
      "\"and if I plug in 120, which I think is the biggest width the answer is 7800\"\n",

      "\"Hi\"\n",
      "\"Hello\"\n",
      "\"Can you tell me what's confusing you, so we can figure out how to work on this together?\"\n",
      "\"i dont know where to start\"\n",
      "\"ok, let me tell you...\"\n",
      "\"sorry\"\n",
      "\"There are basically three steps to follow.\"\n",
      "\"That is fine...\"\n",
      "\"A Cartesian inequality will involve a shaded region of the grid.  Inside that region, all the possible solutions of the inequality will lie\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"for instance, the point (5,0) would be inside the shaded region, because 4(5) - 3(0) > 12 is a true statement\"\n",
      "\"but there are an infinite number of solutions\"\n",
      "\"So, we have to graph a boundary line, and determine which side we need to shade\"\n",
      "\"So the boundary line will be the equation that takes the inequality and makes it an equation by replacing the inequality symbol with an equal sign\"\n",
      "\"So you want to graph the equation 4x - 3y = 12\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"do i have to solve  it fisrt?\"\n",
      "\"first\"\n",
      "\"you dont have to...all you need is two points that satisfy that equation\"\n",
      "\"So you could use 0 for x and solve for y\"\n",
      "\"to find one point\"\n",
      "\"and then use 0 for y and solve for x for the other point\"\n",
      "\"ok -I thought we had to solve the equation\"\n",
      "\"so in this case x=0\"\n",
      "\"what do i do with this\"\n",
      "\"you use the equation at this point\"\n",
      "\"to find the points, you use the equation\"\n",
      "\"where did the 4 come from?\"\n",
      "\"sorry its a zero\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"right\"\n",
      "\"good, so one point is (0,-4)\"\n",
      "\"now look for the other point\"\n",
      "\"so now i solve for x\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"just a second...\"\n",
      "\"you are looking for the other point\"\n",
      "\"where y = 0\"\n",
      "\"you can plug any value in for either variable to find the other one\"\n",
      "\"to find any point on the boundary line\"\n",
      "\"we are finding the intercepts\"\n",
      "\"you are now solving for the x intercept since y = 0\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"Sometimes I find this easier then solving the equation\"\n",
      "\"good\"\n",
      "\"so now you will plot these points on a grid\"\n",
      "\"now you want to look at the inequality  4x - 3y > 12\"\n",
      "\"ok-\"\n",
      "\"Notice there is no equal part to the inequality ( >)\"\n",
      "\"yup\"\n",
      "\"that means you will draw a dashed line\"\n",
      "\"instead of a solid line\"\n",
      "\"oh ok\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"got it\"\n",
      "\"yes it does\"\n",
      "\"then you need to determine which side of the boundary line to shade\"\n",
      "\"you want to choose a test point that is not on the boundary line\"\n",
      "\"ok thats where I'm confused\"\n",
      "\"A good point to choose is the origin (0,0)\"\n",
      "\"ok. i graphed my points and choose (0,0)\"\n",
      "\"you will plug  0 in for x and 0 in for y  and look to see if you are left with a true inequality\"\n",
      "\"or a false inequality\"\n",
      "\"so we get 0 > 12\"\n",
      "\"Is that a true statement?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"0 is greater than 12 ??\"\n",
      "\"no its less then\"\n",
      "\"So this is not a true statement, right?\"\n",
      "\"correct\"\n",
      "\"Since it is not a true statement, then the point (0,0) is not part of the shaded region\"\n",
      "\"so you shade in the other side of the boundary line\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"i think i got\"\n",
      "\"it\"\n",
      "\"Do you have any questions about anything we went over today?\"\n",
      "\"no, but i do have another question if you have a min?\"\n",
      "\"sure\"\n",
      "\"Im going over a practice quiz\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",

      "\"ok\"\n",

      "\"Ok, and what is your question about this?\"\n",
      "\"the answer is (-1,5) how did they get this answer\"\n",
      "\"do I start by solving for y?\"\n",
      "\"you could do that\"\n",
      "\"that would work\"\n",
      "\"solve the first equation for y\"\n",
      "\"you have to do some work to solve for y\"\n",
      "\"actually, you want to solve the first equation for y\"\n",
      "\"and then you want to substitute that in for the y in the other equation\"\n",
      "\"and you would end up solving for x\"\n",
      "\"so i would start by subtracting 1/3x to get y alone\"\n",
      "\"I'm sorry\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Im having a really hard time with this class\"\n",
      "\"that is fine...\"\n",
      "\"so what do i do\"\n",
      "\"just a second...\"\n",
      "\"you need to keep the 1/3 x there with the 16/3\"\n",
      "\"does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"you also need to have a positive y\"\n",
      "\"you can get this by multiplying everything by -1\"\n",
      "\"which will in essence change the sign of everything in the equation\"\n",
      "\"so now you have this equation solved for y\"\n",
      "\"now you have to use the other equation\"\n",
      "\"notice that is y = 1 - 4x\"\n",
      "\"its already solved\"\n",
      "\"right\"\n",

      "\"r\"\n",

      "\"ok, we want to get the x by itself which means that we need to move all the numbers to the other side of the equation\"\n",
      "\"to move numbers to the opposite side of the equation we have to do the opposite operation\"\n",

      "\"If there had been a negative in our first step, the 6 x 6 , then we would have had - 36 as our answer\"\n",

      "\"we can't get -36 with two positives :)\"\n",
      "\"Here we had +36 so we needed to multiply two positives or two negatives.\"\n",
      "\"so, if the number had been - 36, one of the two numbers would have to be negative, would it be the larger or smaller of the two. That is an important rule for me\"\n",
      "\"For example of the 2 and 18 would the 18 have been negative?\"\n",
      "\"Well, we can't know that much without more information. It would be whichever combination added up to the middle number\"\n",

      "\"and you had EITHER +2 -18 OR -2 +18\"\n",

      "\"Do you see what I mean?\"\n",
      "\"ok, on the videos they made a statement about the numbers that would add to what is needed regarding one of the two numbers being negative or positive depending on the number you are working towards, in this case we were looking for 13 (positive), so if the 13 were negative, which of the two numbers (ex 2 and 18) would have had to be negative. I know it does not apply to this problem, but we will have both on the exam\"\n",
      "\"Right!! So if it had been - 1 3 we actually would not have had any options\"\n",
      "\"and I am confused about it\"\n",

      "\"Yes!\"\n",
      "\"But we would want to have a + or - that combines\"\n",
      "\"then wouldn't one of the two numbers need to be a negative and which of the two is it, the larger of the two?\"\n",
      "\"I guess, actually, if we changed only the 13 to negative and still had +36 it would work! we could do -4  and -9\"\n",
      "\"Completely disregard the size of the number\"\n",
      "\"that won't determine the rule\"\n",
      "\"we just want to see what combo adds to the middle\"\n",
      "\"(by the way, you are asking a bunch of really good questions!)\"\n",
      "\"but I don't think both of the numbers are supposed to be negatives, that is my point and a rule that I am stuck on. I know the video made a statement but I need to be sure which of the two it is. This is very important to me. I know both are not supposed to be negative numbers.\"\n",
      "\"Both can be negative numbers.\"\n",
      "\"Trust me on that one\"\n",

      "\"Yes!\"\n",

      "\"and not equal to 1\"\n",
      "\"i know that's what messing me up\"\n",

      "\"?\"\n",
      "\"no\"\n",
      "\"correct\"\n",
      "\"it is not true\"\n",
      "\"therefore, that point (0,0) tells us we shade underneath the line\"\n",
      "\"since (0,0) is above the line\"\n",
      "\"or we shade to the right of the line\"\n",
      "\"basically the opposite side of the line that (0,0) lies\"\n",
      "\"do you understand?\"\n",
      "\"if it made the inequality true, then we would shade the left side where (0,0) was\"\n",
      "\"i think so\"\n",
      "\"Okay, so what part is still confusing for you?\"\n",

      "\"So now we have -11 + 4(61)...\"\n",

      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Great! So now, for the 2nd term, we want to do the same thing but make n = 2\"\n",
      "\"So here, what will we get for 1/2 to the 2nd power?\"\n",
      "\"1/4?\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"So now, we have 5 times 1/4...\"\n",

      "\"5/4?\"\n",
      "\"Terrific!\"\n",
      "\"So the first term is 5/2...\"\n",
      "\"the 2nd tem is 5/4...\"\n",

      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"lets assume that distance they are from salt lake city is given by y\"\n",

      "\"and x is the time they have been driving ...right ?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"very good !\"\n",
      "\"now going through our equation we can see that\"\n",
      "\"we are given that they averaged same for the entire trip\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"so we can say that there is linear relation\"\n",

      "\"after 4 hours , they are 507 miles from salt lake city ....right ?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"so if we write this information in point form ( x,y ) form\"\n",
      "\"x time would be 4  and distance y would be 507\"\n",

      "\"hi\"\n",
      "\"im new to this program\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"thats the problem\"\n",
      "\"first do you recall how to find the least common denominator between the two fractions?\"\n",
      "\"Im thinking 60 but its  a large number\"\n",
      "\"from there i get confused\"\n",

      "\"283\"\n",
      "\"sorry 2 times 3\"\n",
      "\"that is correct\"\n",
      "\"and now what numbers can we multiply to get 10?\"\n",
      "\"2 times 5\"\n",
      "\"right\"\n",
      "\"2\"\n",
      "\"2 is common\"\n",
      "\"and then we have a 3 and 5 as part as well\"\n",
      "\"are you okay on this part?\"\n",
      "\"where are those placed?\"\n",
      "\"we multiply these values to find the least common denominator\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"hang on a moment\"\n",
      "\"first what is 2*3*5?\"\n",
      "\"all together\"\n",
      "\"?\"\n",
      "\"yes, what is 2 times 3 times 5?\"\n",
      "\"30\"\n",
      "\"right so 30 is the LCD\"\n",
      "\"are you okay on this part?\"\n",
      "\"yeah\"\n",
      "\"now with the first fraction, what did we multiply 6 by to get 30?\"\n",
      "\"5\"\n",
      "\"right\"\n",
      "\"so we need to do the same to the numerator\"\n",
      "\"and what does the numerator become?\"\n",
      "\"wait what?\"\n",
      "\"if we multiply the denominator by 5, we also need to do the same to the numerator\"\n",

      "\"yes\"\n",

      "\"what is 7*3 for the numerator?\"\n",
      "\"ummmm\"\n",
      "\"21\"\n",
      "\"that is correct\"\n",
      "\"why though\"\n",
      "\"simplify\"\n",
      "\"since we multiplied the denominator by 3, we must do the same to the numerator\"\n",

      "\"hold on ok\"\n",
      "\"not a problem\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"now since the fractions have the same denominator we can subtract\"\n",
      "\"and what is the result of this step?\"\n",
      "\"4\"\n",
      "\"that is correct for the numerator and we keep the denominator\"\n",

      "\"they don't cancel\"\n",
      "\"no, when add or subtract fractions we only add or subtract the numerator and keep the denominator the same\"\n",

      "\"is that the answer\"\n",
      "\"we need to simplify further\"\n",
      "\"how can we reduce this fraction now?\"\n",

I would have to say that yes in order for there to be a solution or for the inequality to be a true statement or expression it needs to satisfy all sides of the given inequalities, unless fractions or decimals are being considered into the problem. So for example x < 2 > 1. Here when dealing with only constant values no value fulfills or gives you a solution to the problem. But if we were dealing with a fraction or decimal per say then anything between 2.0 and 1.0 would be a valid solution which to me I would say also shows that the inequality does not necessarily need to satisfy both sides\"\n",

      "\"you can stop here.\"\n",
      "\"Since they are not equal or a false statement then I have no solutions to this equation right?\"\n",

      "\"You can write on the white board over here...\"\n",
      "\"ok thanks\"\n",
      "\"can you see the problem\"\n",
      "\"Yes I can.  Do you have an idea of how to begin?\"\n",
      "\"i believe find the sqrt of 24\"\n",
      "\"Not quite. This is a cube root so it's a little different.\"\n",
      "\"Keep going with that thought though because it is going in the right direction.\"\n",
      "\"I may have used the wrong wording\"\n",
      "\"The difference between a square root and a cube root is now many duplicates you need before you can take it out of the root. Let me show you what I mean.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"So with the square root, you only need something to be multiplied by itself once to be able to take it out (take the square root of it). With a cube root, you need something to be multiplied by itself 3 times in order to take it out of the root. Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, it does.... but I think i get stuck with what to do once i figure that out....what exactly do you mean by take it out? and what does that look like?\"\n",
      "\"Great question. So \"\"take it out\"\" is just a way of describing how the root acts on a number. Essentially it is cancelling out a cubic power. Look over at the cube root example I made again..\"\n",
      "\"So the 2*2*2 is the same as 2^3.\"\n",
      "\"Since the cube root and the ^3 are inverse (much like multiplication and division) they will cancel each other out and just leave you with 2\"\n",
      "\"Does that explanation help?\"\n",
      "\"kind of....\"\n",
      "\"So the square root cancels out ^2 since they are both acting on powers of 2.\"\n",
      "\"So with the problem you are working on, you need to break down the number so you can find if there are anything numbers that are repeated 3 times (cubed)\"\n",
      "\"I always start by getting down to the prime factors of the number.\"\n",
      "\"yes the 2 is repeated 3 times\"\n",
      "\"Excellent!!\"\n",
      "\"is this correct\"\n",
      "\"Looks wonderful so far! Do you know what to do next?\"\n",
      "\"??\"\n",
      "\"Close. So anything that there is 3 of (i.e. the 2) you can put it out in front and everything else can stay inside the cube root. Let me show you.\"\n",
      "\"so put the remaining 2 on the outside\"\n",
      "\"can we work another\"\n",
      "\"We sure can.\"\n",
      "\"sorry too many screens up...got lost\"\n",
      "\"No problem. I understand.\"\n",
      "\"Go ahead and do as much as you can and ask questions if you get stuck. I'll watch.\"\n",
      "\"??\"\n",
      "\"Not quite. So this one is a tiny bit different. So there are three 4's so we are going to take all of them and condense them into one 4 outside of the cube root.\"\n",
      "\"Since there are no other numbers left inside, we can just forget about the cube root after that point.\"\n",
      "\"so what happens to the 3\"\n",
      "\"so the answer is 4\"\n",
      "\"There isn't really a 3...that just part of the root.\"\n",
      "\"Correct.\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense?\"\n",

      "\"Could you please tell me a little bit more about what you are working on?\"\n",
      "\"I see you are talking about graphing functions, but what did you mean by \"\"match\"\"?\"\n",
      "\"I am working on the AMP lessons and after I graph a function, dilate it or reflect it I need to answer if the \"\"recently transformed curve matches g(x)?  do they mean if it matched the dotted curve or one of the colored ones?\"\n",
      "\"OH, ok. I am not sure what AMP is, but if you can tell me a little more about the dotted curve and colored curves, I can probably help you out with it.\"\n",
      "\"Is the dotted curve, or one of the colored curves, the original curve, or something else?\"\n",
      "\"I'm working on this...\"\n",
      "\"Sorry, it always says that if I don't type for a while.\"\n",
      "\"Oh sorry, so the original problem is the equation for the transformed function is g(x)=2x.  I understand that it is a linear equation , the part i don't is after I transform it , it asks if the recently transformed curve matches?  I don't know what it means by matches??\"\n",
      "\"Hmmm, that sounds like a good question! So, you only have g(x), you haven't been given an f(x) to transform and then compare to g(x)?\"\n",
      "\"not on this one.  Sometimes they do but i have a hard time knowing what I am supposed to compare?  the transformation to the original, I keep missing them and cannot seem to find the common ground\"\n",

      "\"on this specific problem it says to indicate what the basic function is, and explain the trasformation\"\n",

      "\"Oh, ok. So you've got the function type.\"\n",
      "\"yes, I guess that the basic function would be f(x)=x\"\n",

      "\"yes, and still a linear function\"\n",
      "\"Yes, that's right.\"\n",
      "\"That's about the only thing I can think of that you would say about the transformation. But you think you need more than that?\"\n",
      "\"yes, It asks me to transform it? reflection or dilation and then if it matches?\"\n",
      "\"Is this one of those online homework programs?\"\n",
      "\"it would reflect vertically because 2 is positive right? yes online and i cannot move on until I master a skill.\"\n",
      "\"Ah. Sometimes those programs can be really finicky, too.\"\n",

      "\"My apologies - it is a bit difficult for me to help when I can't see what you see.\"\n",
      "\"the algebric equation is 2x and it graphs another line automatically. now the part I don't understand is where it asks if it matches?? the lines do not overlap so I always so no and miss it everytime.  It specifically says \"\"recently transformed curve matches g(x)? yes or no?\"\n",
      "\"Hmmm, my thought would be, does it make  the same general shape, rather than does it turn out to be the exact same graph.\"\n",
      "\"For example, I would say these two things match\"\n",
      "\"in this case it is a straight line? do these match?\"\n",
      "\"Because if I was to slide the top one down, it would exactly cover the bottom one.\"\n",
      "\"Good question. If your only options are reflection and dilation . . . dilation won't do it. Reflection possibly . . .\"\n",
      "\"If you were to reflect over y=x, would they match? They look like that would be possible.\"\n",
      "\"I just tried it and it said they do match. It must have to do with the shape,\"\n",
      "\"Yes, the shape does have to match, for sure.\"\n",

      "\"That's ok. It's really hard to draw on this white board.\"\n",
      "\"I think that Ive got it figured out. trial and error. Thanks!\"\n",
      "\"Yes, it looks like a reflection across y=x. And they are both straight lines, as you observed.\"\n",

      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"on this question wouldn't the answer be 1.80\"\n",
      "\"Yes, good job!\"\n",
      "\"because you divide 18.00 by 10 correct\"\n",

      "\"you too\"\n",
      "\"Welcome to Tutor.com!  Let's get started.\"\n",
      "\"Is there a specific graph you are trying to plot here?\"\n",
      "\"y=7/8x-7\"\n",
      "\"Great, how do you think we should begin here?\"\n",
      "\"well i was able to plot the -7 i was not able to plot the 7/8 on the line it said i was close but it would not take the answer.\"\n",
      "\"Are you familiar with slope-intercept form from your studies?\"\n",
      "\"i think so i did the problem prior and didn't have any problems..... iam thinking it because it a fraction\"\n",
      "\"Alright, let's do it step-by-step together.\"\n",
      "\"Like you said, the y-intercept is at -7, so, we can plot that:\"\n",
      "\"And we want a slope of 7/8.\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"So that means for every 7 units the line moves up, it moves 8 to the right.\"\n",
      "\"k\"\n",
      "\"So let's see where it would put that dot if it were to travel like that:\"\n",
      "\"7 units up is the origin:\"\n",
      "\"And 8 units to the right is here, at 8,0:\"\n",
      "\"So the line just passes between those two points:\"\n",
      "\"We can even go back and verify that the line passes through (8,0) because (8,0) satisfies the equation y = (7/8)x-7.\"\n",
      "\"so is this the same as when you use the word rise and run\"\n",
      "\"Yes, exactly.\"\n",
      "\"I often just think of the slope as \"\"rise over run.\"\"\"\n",
      "\"It is the change in the y-coordinate, the rise, divided by the change in the x-coordinate, the run.\"\n",
      "\"ok i always have trouble with this\"\n",
      "\"So, rise over run.\"\n",
      "\"Is there a certain part of this you'd like to discuss further?\"\n",
      "\"no i guess i need to just remember rise is first then the run\"\n",
      "\"A large slope will be very steep, and a small one will be very gradual.\"\n",
      "\"\"\"rise over run\"\" is the best way I try to remember it.\"\n",
      "\"Is there anything else you'd like to talk about?\"\n",
      "\"no thank you\"\n",

      "\"Does the problem say anything else?  or is that it?\"\n",
      "\"thats it\"\n",
      "\"Ok cool.  So we can start by splitting the square root there into two separate square roots\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"So instead of having the square root of 81x^5, we split it into the square root of 81 and the square root of x^5\"\n",
      "\"9 x 9\"\n",
      "\"=81\"\n",
      "\"Right, the square root of 81 is 9\"\n",
      "\"nice work\"\n",
      "\"So we can replace the square root of 81 with just 9\"\n",
      "\"And then we have the square root of x^5\"\n",
      "\"Do you have any ideas for how we can simplify that?\"\n",
      "\"no\"\n",
      "\"Let's think of x^5 as x*x*x*x*x\"\n",
      "\"Now we can rewrite that as x^2 times x^2 times x\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense how we go from x*x*x*x*x to x^2 * x^2 * x?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"72\"\n",
      "\"Right, 8 times 9 will be 72\"\n",
      "\"And we can split this square root up again\"\n",
      "\"like that\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"What is the square root of x^2?\"\n",
      "\"x\"\n",
      "\"Right\"\n",
      "\"72x^2\"\n",
      "\"Correct, nice job!\"\n",

      "\"At the beginning of the summer Molly decided to add a little money into her savings account every week. After seven weeks her account had $175. At the end of 15 weeks her account had $375. Assume that she put the same amount into her account every week and will continue  to do so\"\n",
      "\"Am I right\"\n",
      "\"Yes, that's right for the slope of the line!\"\n",
      "\"But what are you asked to find here?\"\n",
      "\"I need to know what is the expression i need to put to find the variable for the number of weeks she began saving\"\n",
      "\"Well, the variable would just be a letter that you want to use to represent the number of weeks, right?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"So what letter would you like to use for that?\"\n",
      "\"y=mx+b\"\n",
      "\"OK, that's the equation for the whole line; but in that equation, the x would be the variable for the number of weeks, and the y would be the variable for the amount of money in the account.\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes'\"\n",
      "\"So x is what you would put for the variable for the number of weeks.\"\n",
      "\"Then we need to find the expression mx + b for the y.\"\n",
      "\"y=25x+b\"\n",
      "\"Good!\"\n",
      "\"And then can you use the given information to find what b is?\"\n",
      "\"That's where i'm confused at\"\n",
      "\"OK, well, in order to find the b we have to use one of the points that are on the line.\"\n",
      "\"Do you know how to express the given information in points (x,y)?\"\n",
      "\"no\"\n",
      "\"OK, well, for instance, what is the amount in the account when x = 7?\"\n",
      "\"(i.e. at 7 weeks)?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"But how much money is in the account at that time?\"\n",
      "\"175\"\n",
      "\"Right, so that means that y = 175 when x = 7, or (7, 175) is a point on the line.\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"OK, good!\"\n",
      "\"So then to find what b is in the equation y = 25x + b, we would replace x by 7 and y by 175 and then solve for b.\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"OK, good!\"\n",
      "\"So what do you get for b if you try that?\"\n",
      "\"25\"\n",
      "\"Well, that's a good try!\"\n",
      "\"But could you double check that or show me what you did?\"\n",
      "\"175/7\"\n",
      "\"Well, let's take a look at that.\"\n",
      "\"We have to replace the y by 175 and the x by 7 in the equation y = 25x + b:\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"OK, so now we have to get the b by itself in that equation.\"\n",
      "\"First we would evaluate 25(7) on the right side.\"\n",
      "\"What is that?\"\n",
      "\"add\"\n",
      "\"Well, 25(7) means 25 * 7, doesn't it?\"\n",
      "\"oh yes sorry\"\n",
      "\"That's OK\"\n",
      "\"So what is 25*7?\"\n",
      "\"175\"\n",
      "\"Good!\"\n",
      "\"So now we have to get the b by itself in that equation.\"\n",
      "\"Do you know how we would do that?\"\n",
      "\"  can't remember\"\n",
      "\"OK, well, we have to get rid of the 175 on the right side, so we have to do the opposite operation.\"\n",
      "\"subtract\"\n",
      "\"The 175 is added to the b; what is the opposite of addition?\"\n",
      "\"Right!\"\n",
      "\"0\"\n",
      "\"So we subtract 175 from both sides.\"\n",
      "\"Excellent!\"\n",
      "\"So b = 0.\"\n",
      "\"What do you get if you plug in 0 for b in our equation y = 25x + b?\"\n",
      "\"0\"\n",
      "\"Well, just the b is 0, right?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"But what does the equation become if you replace b by 0 and leave everything else the same in y = 25x + b?\"\n",
      "\"25x+0\"\n",
      "\"Right, and can you simplify that?\"\n",
      "\"no\"\n",
      "\"Well, anything plus 0 is just itself, right?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"So that means that 25x + 0 is the same as 25x.\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"OK, great!\"\n",
      "\"So 25x is the expression for the amount of money in the account after x weeks.\"\n",
      "\"Do you have any questions on what we did for that?\"\n",
      "\"So its 25x+0\"\n",
      "\"Well, yes, but usually we would simplify it to 25x, as we said above.\"\n",
      "\"so just add 25x\"\n",
      "\"for the expression\"\n",
      "\"Yes, the expression for the money in the account.\"\n",

      "\"Okay great question!\"\n",
      "\"did they already give you part of the coordinate?\"\n",
      "\"No, I entered those in\"\n",
      "\"ooo ok...\"\n",
      "\"0 is a great place to start!\"\n",
      "\"So you let y = 0\"\n",
      "\"now you just need to solve the equation for x\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"would you like to do this together on the whiteboard?\"\n",
      "\"sure!\"\n",

      "\"sure\"\n",
      "\"yes... looking good!\"\n",
      "\"what's your next step going to be?\"\n",
      "\"subtract 10 from both sides\"\n",
      "\"bingo!\"\n",
      "\"okay, final step?\"\n",
      "\"divide 4 on both sides\"\n",

      "\"Bingo!\"\n",
      "\"multiply both sides by 4/5\"\n",
      "\"this isolates x...\"\n",
      "\"so -10 times 4 = -40\"\n",
      "\"seems easy enough:)\"\n",
      "\"-40 / 5 = ?\"\n",
      "\"Should I simply that?\"\n",
      "\"yes, how many times does 5 go into 40?\"\n",

      "\"AH ok!\"\n",
      "\"Im a little confused with graphting\"\n",
      "\"no problem, I can help you with this!\"\n",

      "\"I will show you on the whiteboard, then you can apply it to the actual problem\"\n",
      "\"k\"\n",
      "\"so all coordinate pairs are given in the form (x, y)\"\n",

      "\"is the first number (for example -8) is going to be on the x-axis\"\n",
      "\"and the second number (0) will be on the y-axis... just like battleship...\"\n",

      "\"0 units up or down\"\n",

      "\"ok\"\n",

      "\"sure\"\n",
      "\"0 units left or right\"\n",
      "\"10 units up\"\n",
      "\"careful!\"\n",
      "\"we must always start at the origin\"\n",
      "\"Bingo!\"\n",
      "\"I should have started on 0\"\n",
      "\"the line isn't necessary on the graph... I was just showing you my thought process... exactly!\"\n",
      "\"so now you can plot the point :)\"\n",
      "\"Ok! sounds easy on this one!\"\n",
      "\"How about when I plot fractions? The slope.\"\n",
      "\"Good question, let's finish up this graph then I can answer that...\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"we still need the final point, and the line through both points...\"\n",
      "\"so you see how I used the points to sketch the line?\"\n",
      "\"yep\"\n",
      "\"Great, now I know you can solve that problem, just wanted to make sure I covered that with you :) ...\"\n",
      "\"now to answer your second question...\"\n",
      "\"let's say you are given the slope of an equation... m=2/3\"\n",
      "\"and you want to graph this equation that goes through the origin... or (0,0)\"\n",
      "\"m stands for slope\"\n",
      "\"think of it as \"\"Rise/Run\"\"\"\n",
      "\"you rise up two units\"\n",
      "\"and go over three units...\"\n",
      "\"See how that works?\"\n",
      "\"oh ok. So we rised up 2 units and went over 3?\"\n",
      "\"opposite of what you said...\"\n",
      "\"we rose up 3 units\"\n",
      "\"and ran 2 units\"\n",
      "\"so the bottom number is always the rise?\"\n",
      "\"oops!\"\n",
      "\"I wrote the slope incorrectly :(\"\n",
      "\"my bad, let me fix this...\"\n",
      "\"haha\"\n",
      "\"sorry for the confusion...\"\n",
      "\"thats ok!\"\n",
      "\"Now thats better!\"\n",
      "\"let's just assume we had a slope of 3/2 instead :)\"\n",
      "\"nice catch!\"\n",
      "\"So up 3 and across 2\"\n",
      "\"yes, exactly\"\n",
      "\"ok that makes sense  and this is only when the question asks for a slope right?\"\n",
      "\"The question will usually give you the slope, and one other piece of information... usually a point on the line\"\n",
      "\"for this question, I used the point (0,0)\"\n",
      "\"but they could give you another point...\"\n",
      "\"if they do give you another point, you can use \"\"Point-Slope Form\"\" of an equation to simplify and to graph\"\n",
      "\"would you like to see this form? it's up to you :)\"\n",
      "\"ok, cause I noticed some problems that ended up with fractions I couldnt do the rise over run.\"\n",
      "\"yes, I can see it\"\n",
      "\"(x1, y1) is any point that they give you\"\n",
      "\"and m is the given slope\"\n",
      "\"let's say they give you (4, -7) as a point with a slope m = -3...\"\n",
      "\"follow me so far?\"\n",
      "\"umm kind of\"\n",
      "\"sorry if I am off track we can stop here... what would you like to do this is your session :)\"\n",
      "\"Ok I see! You just entered the number where the x would be.\"\n",
      "\"exactly!\"\n",
      "\"you could keep going, I just never got to this point yet!haha\"\n",
      "\"okay I can finish this up in no time... stop me if you have any questions or if I am confusing you ;)\"\n",
      "\"will do!\"\n",
      "\"so you are exactly right...\"\n",
      "\"i substituted this value in for x1\"\n",
      "\"and -7 in for y1\"\n",
      "\"now we can get rid of the ugly parentheses...\"\n",
      "\"and we usually want the form y = mx + b\"\n",
      "\"where m is the slope\"\n",
      "\"and b is the intercept...\"\n",
      "\"this makes it easier to graph...\"\n",
      "\"when I plug in 0 for x, what do I get for y?\"\n",
      "\"5\"\n",
      "\"Yes!\"\n",
      "\"(0, 5) is a point\"\n",
      "\"this is our y-intercept (where the graph crosses over the y-axis)\"\n",
      "\"so i always should get the y intercept first?\"\n",
      "\"in this form, yes\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"it's the easiest way to graph\"\n",
      "\"BUT...\"\n",
      "\"all you need to graph is two points...\"\n",
      "\"so any two points will do!\"\n",
      "\"these are just the easiest ones :)\"\n",
      "\"and I like easy ;)\"\n",
      "\"SO do I!!!!\"\n",
      "\"now the slope is -3\"\n",
      "\"we can think of this as -3/1\"\n",
      "\"make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"so we rise up -3 units (or go down 3 units, same thing)\"\n",
      "\"that puts me at 2\"\n",
      "\"and we go over 1 unit\"\n",
      "\"ok I got it! So I start at 5 then go down 3 and over 1\"\n",

      "\"very good\"\n",
      "\"Now can you please guess the next?\"\n",

      "\"well we can reduce it a bit\"\n",
      "\"can you try to reduce?\"\n",

      "\"I'm fine too :)\"\n",
      "\"So, for this problem...\"\n",
      "\"Have you been able to begin?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, I just get to applying exponent and then every move I make from there in AMP shows I'm not doing it right.\"\n",
      "\"ok... well, let's take a look at what you've done so far :)\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"This is my first time using tutor.com btw\"\n",
      "\"oh ok, welcome!\"\n",
      "\"Let me know if you need help with anything :)\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"You can show me the work you've done so far, either on the board...\"\n",
      "\"or in this chat box...\"\n",
      "\"is that legible?\"\n",
      "\"yes, definitely :)\"\n",
      "\"Did you lose a minus sign here:\"\n",
      "\"?\"\n",
      "\"yes, thanks\"\n",
      "\"You're welcome :)\"\n",
      "\"So, I'm where I get stuck\"\n",
      "\"hmm...\"\n",
      "\"I understand that I can simplify the fraction into an 8\"\n",
      "\"Does the system say that the 1st step is correct?\"\n",
      "\"yes. let me do that part, then I'll verify\"\n",
      "\"ok...\"\n",
      "\"oops, there is a negative in the fraction\"\n",
      "\"yes, that's what I thought\"\n",
      "\"um, but wouldn't negative one to the second power be positive?\"\n",
      "\"Well, it's tricky how it's written...\"\n",
      "\"Notice that the original problem says -1^2, not (-1)^2\"\n",
      "\"oh\"\n",
      "\"if it says -1^2, then only the 1 is squared, not the negative sign\"\n",
      "\"so it's negative sign times 1 times 1\"\n",
      "\"devil is in the details\"\n",
      "\"which is -1\"\n",
      "\"definitely :)\"\n",
      "\"but (-1)^2 would mean -1 times -1\"\n",
      "\"which would make 1\"\n",
      "\"Ok, so, would I simplify the fraction next?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"now the fraction is - 8/-1\"\n",
      "\"What would that simplify to?\"\n",
      "\"8?\"\n",
      "\"that's right... so +8\"\n",
      "\"or -8?\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Well, the whole thing would be +8\"\n",
      "\"if you want to, you can write it as - (-8)\"\n",
      "\"I had to for AMP\"\n",
      "\"which would then become +8 in the next step\"\n",
      "\"oh ok\"\n",
      "\"Then, it's just combining like terms\"\n",
      "\"right?\"\n",
      "\"we could, yes...\"\n",
      "\"What would the expression become then?\"\n",
      "\"-6x*64+15\"\n",
      "\"Excellent!\"\n",
      "\"And 1 step left :)\"\n",
      "\"When I tried to combing 64 and 15 on AMP, it won't let me!\"\n",
      "\"that's right, because we can't combine them :)\"\n",
      "\"Let's look at the order of operations\"\n",
      "\"What do we do with the 64 first? Do we multiply it to the -6x? Or do we add it to the 15?\"\n",
      "\"multiplication first\"\n",
      "\"yes, exactly\"\n",
      "\"it won't let you do the addition first\"\n",
      "\"Now if multiplication is first, then why did I combine the 8 and 7?\"\n",
      "\"well, when you brought it up, I said \"\"we could do it that way, yes\"\"...\"\n",
      "\"basically, there are two steps to do:\"\n",
      "\"one is to multiply the -6x times 64\"\n",
      "\"the other is to do 8 + 7\"\n",
      "\"each of those steps doesn't affect the other...\"\n",
      "\"so we can do it in either order\"\n",
      "\"If we would have done -6x times 64 first and then 8 + 7, it would have been ok too\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"but if we try to do 64 + 15, that's not correct\"\n",
      "\"because 64 must be mutiplied to the -6x first\"\n",
      "\"Ok. I answered it through AMP too.\"\n",
      "\"Excellent!\"\n",
      "\"Does this problem make sense to you now?\"\n",
      "\"So, it will simplify to -384x+15\"\n",
      "\"yup\"\n",
      "\"It makes a lot more sense now and I think with practice, I will truly get it.\"\n",
      "\"Thank you so much and if I have any more trouble, I know where to go.\"\n",

      "\"Hello! My name is Jonathan, thank you for having your question loeded\"\n",
      "\"Let's start to talk this out,  part by part\"\n",
      "\"I really would rather see it done.\"\n",
      "\"Right, we will do this visually\"\n",
      "\"So, it's three main ideas, one by one\"\n",
      "\"Thanks!! I am much better with videos\"\n",
      "\"Let's say we have a fraction, any fraction at all,. how about 3/4\"\n",
      "\"this is part of our first idea\"\n",
      "\"would you agree we can multiply the top and bottom by the same thing, to get a new \"\"equivalent\"\" fraction?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Like if we multiply the top and bottom by 6, we get 18 / 24...\"\n",
      "\"Great, that is our first idea here, that we multiply the top and bottom by the same thing\"\n",
      "\"so far so good?\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"great, our next idea is multiplying with roots.\"\n",
      "\"Say we had 6 times root 7\"\n",
      "\"A root times a number, you actually do no math\"\n",
      "\"so, 6 times rooot 7, just becomes 6root 7, no actual math is done\"\n",
      "\"Still perfect?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"great, lastly, if we have two of the same roots, the roots cancel\"\n",
      "\"so root 7 times root 7 is just normal 7\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"these are our main three ideas, and we will start your problem on a new page if you are ready\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"So, how could we cancel \"\"root 3\"\", using that third idea we talked about on the last page?\"\n",
      "\"multiply it by the square root of 3\"\n",
      "\"Great, and would we do that to the top, the bottom, or both parts of this fraction\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"so, this is based on our first idea, so I need you to answer\"\n",
      "\"would we multiply A) only the top, B), only the bottom, or C) both\"\n",
      "\"I'm sorry but this is not helping\"\n",
      "\"with fractions, you have to multiply both parts, the top and bottom by the same thing.\"\n",
      "\"So, it's really only our two main ideas\"\n",
      "\"it's the same ideas as the 3/4\"\n",
      "\"if we want, we can multiply the top and bottom by the same thing, to get a new fraction\"\n",
      "\"So, fractions, multiply top and bottom, that's our \"\"key\"\" today\"\n",
      "\"you wanted to multiply by root 3, and that is a great idea\"\n",
      "\"So, with fractions, we multiply the top and bottom by the same thing\"\n",
      "\"so here we multiply both top and bottom by root 3\"\n",
      "\"  I've got that done now where do I go from here\"\n",
      "\"okay, what does the top come to, 6 times root (3)?\"\n",
      "\"its 6square root of three\"\n",
      "\"great, if we zoom on the bottom, what is root 3 times root 3?\"\n",
      "\"3\"\n",
      "\"+6\"\n",
      "\"so 9\"\n",
      "\"it is times, on the bottom\"\n",
      "\"18\"\n",
      "\"great\"\n",
      "\"we can reduce whole numbers, if we see them\"\n",
      "\"So, what does 6/18 reduce to?\"\n",
      "\"2/3\"\n",
      "\"oops, close, can you double check that\"\n",
      "\"1/3\"\n",
      "\"great, so we have 1 root (3) / 6, as our final answer\"\n",
      "\"things inside roots can not be reduced\"\n",
      "\"That is not the answer of the problem on my practice test this is my issue\"\n",
      "\"okay, what is the answer in the practice test?\"\n",
      "\"Its says it is supposed to be 12-2square root of 3 over 11...This is why I am so confused. I am really good at this stuff and this just completely threw me off.\"\n",
      "\"okay, was there a plus or minus between the 6 and root 3 on the starting problem?\"\n",
      "\"+\"\n",
      "\"and that was our main error, that was not in the version we wored\"\n",
      "\"*worked\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"so, this is a new idea, and that is okay.\"\n",
      "\"So, new idea, called a \"\"conjugate\"\"\"\n",
      "\"If we change a plus to a minus, in a term you get it's conjugate\"\n",
      "\"for example x+3 and x-3 are conjugates\"\n",
      "\"same thing, just a plus instead of a minus, so far so good?\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"so, what would the conjugate of 6 +root(3) be?\"\n",
      "\"6-square root of 3\"\n",
      "\"great, so we are going to multiply the top and bottom by that\"\n",
      "\"Perfect so far?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"great, what does the top come out to, if we distribute?\"\n",
      "\"36-6 square root of 3\"\n",
      "\"awesome, and if we run FOIL on the bottom?\"\n",
      "\"33\"\n",
      "\"awesome\"\n",
      "\"ok now I've got the answer thanks\"\n",

      "\"Ok.\"\n",
      "\"I'm going to rewrite this problem and put the divided by (25x^-1) on the bottom.\"\n",
      "\"Okay\"\n",
      "\"Okay, I'm with you on that\"\n",
      "\"When you have x 's on top and bottom, you subtract the exponents.\"\n",
      "\"The reason I wrote 6 is 5 - (-1) = 6.\"\n",

      "\"Hmmm...so it will always be subtract the bottom exponent from the top exponent?\"\n",
      "\"Always top - bottom, then you can put it on the top.\"\n",
      "\"And then I remove the variable from the bottom when I do that?\"\n",
      "\"Yes.  But wait just a minute...\"\n",
      "\"I thought the 5^2 x^-1 went with both of the parts.  It only goes with the last part.  That's an easy fix.\"\n",
      "\"I'm just going to erase the 25x^-1 below -7x^5.\"\n",
      "\"Okay\"\n",
      "\"There is one more step.\"\n",

      "\"I have to combine these two parts, which means I have to get a common denominator.\"\n",
      "\"This is where I am more confused - the AMP multiplies the numbers\"\n",
      "\"I am going to put a 1 under -7x^5 just so they are both fractions.\"\n",
      "\"Okay\"\n",
      "\"My common denominator will be 25 because 1 goes into 25 and 25 goes into 25 evenly.\"\n",
      "\"Ah, and we cannot add fractions without a common denominator....\"\n",
      "\"Right.\"\n",
      "\"Since I have to multiply 1 by 25 to get 25, I have to multiply the top (-7x^5) by 25 also.\"\n",
      "\"Okay\"\n",
      "\"I don't have to multiply the second fraction by anything because it already has the 25 on the bottom.\"\n",
      "\"Okay...I believe I am beginning to recall\"\n",

      "\"I have to  graph the equation using any two points\"\n",
      "\"Okay.  There are a couple of different ways you can find points to graph this equation.  One method I think is really easy is to plug in 0 for x, see what you get for y and then plug in 0 for y and see what you get for x.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"This is called graphing using the intercepts.  You don't have to use this method if you like another better.\"\n",

      "\"Um it should be 13 1/3\"\n",
      "\"ok so i need to reduce it\"\n",
      "\"but what would be in decimal form?\"\n",
      "\"Well 3/6 reduces to 1/2 so it's a little off.  Probably just an addition or subtraction error.\"\n",
      "\"13.5\"\n",
      "\"1/3 would be .333333\"\n",

      "\"if suppose it was -125x^3 - 1\"\n",
      "\"or  if that was 125x^3 - 1\"\n",

      "\"Do you have any questions on what we did here ?\"\n",
      "\"not now thanks again, that was very helpful\"\n",
      "\"You are most welcome!\"\n",
      "\"Welcome to tutor.com! How can I help you?\"\n",
      "\"Hi, were you able to get the attachment that I uploaded\"\n",
      "\"I have! Have you been able to get anywhere with either of these problems?\"\n",
      "\"I was a little unsure on how she wanted part A of number 21 done\"\n",
      "\"I wanted to put 2xy^3\"\n",
      "\"Well, let's think on that:\"\n",
      "\"How would you describe the area of one of these rectangles?\"\n",
      "\"2x*y\"\n",
      "\"(2x)y\"\n",
      "\"You can just write it as 2xy, since x and y are both variables.\"\n",
      "\"oh okay. I had the right idea then\"\n",
      "\"Now, it's asking us to find a monomial equal to the sum of these, right?\"\n",
      "\"since there are 3 do you add a third power\"\n",
      "\"or 6xy\"\n",
      "\"6xy would be better. We're asked to find the sum, not multiply them.\"\n",
      "\"okay, I get it\"\n",
      "\"So, what would your answer to part b be?\"\n",
      "\"so we would multiply 2x3 X4?\"\n",
      "\"Right.\"\n",
      "\"because x is 3 and y is 4\"\n",
      "\"so 24 x3\"\n",
      "\"Well, you can just do 6(3)(4), since you're looking for the sum, anyways.\"\n",
      "\"Right.\"\n",
      "\"72\"\n",
      "\"And that's your solution! Very well done.\"\n",
      "\"Now, do you also need help with the second problem, or do you think you have it?\"\n",
      "\"can you please assist with the second as well?\"\n",
      "\"Sure!\"\n",
      "\"So, how far have you been able to get?\"\n",
      "\"I dont have any idea where to start\"\n",
      "\"That's fine.\"\n",
      "\"Well, let's start with the formula they offered:\"\n",
      "\"Which should actually be r^3, not r^2.\"\n",
      "\"Still, let's assume it's r^2 for starters:\"\n",
      "\"why would it change?\"\n",
      "\"Well, it doesn't, technically. However, it doesn't hurt to have the answer they specifically asked for (using r^2) even though the actual formula for the volume of a cube uses r^3,\"\n",
      "\"Exactly. It's why we'll just start with r^2, and move from there, since we need to anyways to get r^3.\"\n",
      "\"So:\"\n",
      "\"We'll worry about 4/3 and pi at the end.\"\n",
      "\"Can you foil that?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"What does it get you?\"\n",
      "\"x^2 +4x+4\"\n",
      "\"Very good. Now, at this point, if we were solving using r^2, we would just multiply this all by 4/3*pi.\"\n",
      "\"However, we shall continue forward.\"\n",
      "\"Can you foil that?\"\n",
      "\"will try lol\"\n",
      "\"x^3 +6x^2+12x+8\"\n",
      "\"Very good.\"\n",
      "\"oh wow\"\n",
      "\"And you could continue using that method if you had to.\"\n",
      "\"There's a formula for it, but we won't worry about that now, since it's only to the third power.\"\n",
      "\"So, let's use that for our answer:\"\n",
      "\"Personally, I'd accept that as the answer, but it wouldn't hurt to distribute that.\"\n",
      "\"the instructor never said anything. She never went over this.\"\n",
      "\"she just said we needed to have the answer in terms of TT\"\n",
      "\"Well, that means you leave pi as it is, rather than change it to its number estimate, 3.14.\"\n",
      "\"so this is the answer then?\"\n",
      "\"It is. If you wanted to distribute it through, you could.\"\n",
      "\"Just multiply each part of the equation with 4/3*pi\"\n",
      "\"I will leave it as is.  Thank you so much you have been so helpful\"\n",

      "\"what would subtract what?\"\n",
      "\"OK - you could do the top minus the bottom if you want to keep your answer on the top.\"\n",

      "\"Well, usually we just start with the one that's the biggest....\"\n",

      "\"ok the denominator\"\n",
      "\"let's go 2.06 - 0.06\"\n",
      "\"yes, right!\"\n",
      "\"and then the n gets written there.\"\n",

      "\"right!  And what happens to the negative sign?\"\n",
      "\"?.\"\n",
      "\"yes - there is fine!\"\n",

      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"now we have to convert it inbto mix fraction\"\n",

      "\"so as 40*9= 360\"\n",

      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"like as shown on the board\"\n",

      "\":)\"\n",
      "\"now we will factorize the expression inside the bracket that is 5x^2 +8x +3 by the ac method\"\n",

      "\"Would you like to give it a try?\"\n",
      "\"please wait\"\n",

      "\"yes\"\n",

      "\"Agreed ..?\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"now let's take the common factor out from the 2nd group\"\n",

      "\"x?\"\n",
      "\"x is not with 3 in the 2nd bracket\"\n",
      "\"so it can't be a common factor\"\n",
      "\"in 5x and 3 there is 1 common\"\n",
      "\"since we can write 5x as 1*5x and 3 as 1*3\"\n",
      "\"so 1 is the common factor\"\n",
      "\"does this step make sense ?\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"so let's write the remaining factors in the bracket\"\n",
      "\"Very Good :)\"\n",
      "\"can you guess the next step ?\"\n",
      "\"i dont know what you call it\"\n",
      "\"we can see that (5x+3) is the common factor in the expression ..right ?\"\n",

      "\"when you multiple those figures inside the sqr root you add the powers\"\n",
      "\"well... the Y^0 could be taken out of the square root and that would allow you to add the 0 and the 7 for the Y\"\n",

      "\"I'll show you in a second.... but there is another issue...\"\n",
      "\"the square root should also multiply the 8\"\n",
      "\"did you see how I distributed the square root?\"\n",
      "\"Nope lost\"\n",
      "\"let me rewrite the top\"\n",
      "\"that's the top as originally given, right?\"\n",

      "\"now I need to multiply that by the square root that we're using...\"\n",

      "\"and so, before I can multiply the square roots, I need to distribute the square root\"\n",
      "\"So the box model would be used?....oh!!!!\"\n",

      "\"I'm working on this...\"\n",
      "\"y=-7/3x-7, graph the equation by two points!  I know that one point is (0, -7), but I am lost within point two (-2.3333, ?)\"\n",

      "\"or is that given in the problem?\"\n",
      "\"given within the problem!\"\n",
      "\"oh okay, cool\"\n",
      "\"so if it's given as (-2.333, ?) then do you know if you're missing the x-value or the y-value?\"\n",
      "\"-2.3333 comes from -7/3\"\n",
      "\"x value correct?\"\n",
      "\"right!\"\n",
      "\"so what can we do to find the corresponding y-value?\"\n",
      "\"this is where my understanding gets cloudy!\"\n",
      "\"oh okay, well, the way a line works is that it's the set of all the (x,y) points that make whatever the equation is true\"\n",
      "\"so like, we can use y=-7/3x-7 and plug in whatever we want for x and y, but only certain values will make the equation true\"\n",
      "\"so you already have the point (0,-7), which means that if we plug in x = 0 and y = -7 into that equation, we should get something true\"\n",
      "\"does that make sense what I have over there using the equation and the point (0, -7)?\"\n",
      "\"yes!  I confused myself by not using 0 as point!\"\n",
      "\"oh, I understand, it's very easy to confuse yourself with math homework\"\n",
      "\"so do you think you can figure out how to find the missing y-coordinate with the x-coordinate of -2.33333?\"\n",
      "\"I am still kind of confused!\"\n",
      "\"ok, I'll set up something similar to what I just set up using the other point\"\n",
      "\"but, is it correct that -7/3 is -2.3333\"\n",
      "\"yup, they're the same\"\n",
      "\"when you're doing the arithmetic, it's easier to keep it as a fraction, but when you're graphing it's easier to use a decimal, so you can just kind of decide which way you like better\"\n",
      "\"OK!\"\n",
      "\"so in the second setup, we don't know what the y-coordinate is yet, like we did in the first one\"\n",
      "\"so the only thing we can really substitute for is the x-coordinate\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"does that next line make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"okay awesome, then all we need to do is some algebra to figure out what y should equal to make the equation true\"\n",
      "\"do you remember how to multiply fractions?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"ok cool, do you feel comfortable solving that equation then?\"\n",
      "\"no! but do you invert and cross multiply?\"\n",
      "\"inversion is when you're dividing fractions, multiplying fractions is actually way easier\"\n",

      "\"haha, well that's fine, i'm trying to find a good way to set it up on the whiteboard\"\n",
      "\"ok!\"\n",
      "\"man, that was way more complicated than it needed to be!\"\n",
      "\"anyway, it's set up now with those huge numbers\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"to multiply fractions, you just have to multiply the numerators and the denominators\"\n",
      "\"-49/9\"\n",
      "\"you have one small error but otherwise perfect\"\n",
      "\"remember what happens when you multiply a negative and a negative\"\n",
      "\"the negative\"\n",
      "\"positive\"\n",
      "\"yup, a negative times a negative is a positive!\"\n",
      "\"ok I'll add the next line in the equation\"\n",
      "\"now this is where you either do the subtraction by hand or in a calculator\"\n",
      "\"how would you like to do it?\"\n",
      "\"the answer we get will be your y-coordinate, so we're very close to being done\"\n",
      "\"by hand!  5.44 would that be close?\"\n",
      "\"that's 49/9 in decimal form, so all you need to do now is subtract 7 from it and you'll have your answer\"\n",
      "\"1.5555\"\n",
      "\"yup! and 7 is greater than 5.44 so we should actually get a negative\"\n",
      "\"-1.5555\"\n",
      "\"perfect\"\n",
      "\"and you're supposed to graph the line with those two points?\"\n",
      "\"ok!  I just have to slow down and not panic!\"\n",
      "\"yup, a lot of math is about talking to yourself and going slow\"\n",
      "\"thank you very much!  I will practice on paper by using different numbers as well!\"\n",
      "\"okay cool, no problem! are you good with plotting the points and creating the graph?\"\n",
      "\"another way you can practice is by plugging in other values for the x-coordinate and seeing what you get for the y-coordinate, or plugging in values for the y-coordinate and seeing what you get for the x-coordinate\"\n",
      "\"yes, i can do that part, it was just remembering the steps on the eqaution\"\n",

      "\"So what's being called x, the width?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",

      "\"Yeah, you're in the right ball park, but not quite\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",

      "\"Instead of 160 + 4(3), you want 160 - 4(3)\"\n",
      "\"Since those 4 vertical walls are taking away 12 feet of the 160 feet of siding he has to use; if the length is 172, then he's already using more than the 160 feet of siding he bought\"\n",

      "\"There you go\"\n",

      "\"yes  but kind of confused as to how i got it\"\n",

      "\"Ok, sure, let's go ahead and do that. So, the first important piece of information is that Melinda drove five miles before she even started riding her bike\"\n",
      "\"So, let's make a little picture depicting that...\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Alright, so next they tell us that Melinda and her friend start riding their bikes farther away at 13 miles per hour, yes?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Ok, so the physical interpretation of that would be that every hour, they have gotten 13 miles farther away from the house\"\n",
      "\"ok i needed to know that\"\n",
      "\"Yep, so after 1 hour of riding, they've gone 13 MORE miles\"\n",
      "\"Which means they're a total of 18 miles away (which is the answer to number 1)\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Ok, so let's add that to our picture...\"\n",
      "\"Ok, now we know they're still riding their bikes at 13 miles per hour, yeah? So, if they rid for another full hour, they'll have gone another 13 miles. Do you agree?\"\n",
      "\"so every 13 miles equals 1hour\"\n",
      "\"ok i see it\"\n",
      "\"Yes ma'am, exactly right. Ok, so let's see how far away they are at two hours. If they were 18 miles away, then rode another 13 miles away, how far away are they now?\"\n",
      "\"thats 31\"\n",
      "\"at 2 hours\"\n",

      "\"Ok. So, where do I begin with that\"\n",
      "\"ok.. what they are askgin is if we have some number they are calling \"\"X\"\".  then if we take 4 from that number, we get 10\"\n",

      "\"ok.. since we knwo this will eqaul 7, and is set kinda like yours.. let's do the same steps..\"\n",

      "\"Welcome to Tutor.com! How can I help you today?\"\n",
      "\"I need help solving system of equations3\"\n",
      "\"Ok great I can help you with that!\"\n",
      "\"What is the problem?\"\n",
      "\"I'm not sure how to tackle this problem\"\n",
      "\"Ok great. Do you need to solve by substitution or elimination? Or either?\"\n",
      "\"according to the answers it wants to know if it is consistent or inconsistent\"\n",
      "\"Ok. Are you familiar with either elimination or substitution?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Ok great. Which method would you like to use?\"\n",
      "\"elimination\"\n",
      "\"Ok great.\"\n",
      "\"And does that say y=6x-7 for the second equation?\"\n",
      "\"no it says y=6x=7\"\n",
      "\"Hm. Okay.\"\n",
      "\"So it seems like we need to plug in either y, or 6x, or 7 for y=6x-6\"\n",
      "\"And not use elimination here\"\n",
      "\"Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"I'm sorry it is y-6x=7\"\n",
      "\"For the second equation?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Ah okay great\"\n",
      "\"So let's get the first equation to be in that form as well.\"\n",
      "\"So let's move the 6x to the other side, how do we do that?\"\n",
      "\"I think we combine them\"\n",
      "\"Well we want to first move the 6x to the other side of the equation in the first equation\"\n",
      "\"How do we do that?\"\n",
      "\"can you show me what you\"\n",
      "\"are talking about\"\n",
      "\"Yes,\"\n",
      "\"By moving 6x to the other side we need to subtract it\"\n",
      "\"Do you understand how I did that?\"\n",
      "\"no\"\n",
      "\"Ok in order to move 6x to the other side of the equation, we subtract it. This is because 6x is positive, so we do the opposite operation to move it\"\n",
      "\"So 6x-6x=0 so that cancels on the right hand side\"\n",
      "\"Is this making more sense?\"\n",
      "\"ok I get that part but why subtract from the y\"\n",
      "\"Well whatever we do on one side of the equation we have to do on the other side of the equation\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Make sense?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"Now let's look at these two equations\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"We have y-6x=-6 and y-6x=7\"\n",
      "\"What do you notice about what I underlined in purple?\"\n",
      "\"the y\"\n",
      "\"Yes, they both have y and they both have -6x, so they are the same\"\n",
      "\"but what are they equal to?\"\n",
      "\"1\"\n",
      "\"Well one equation is equal to -6 and one is equal to 7\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"So the left hand sides of the equations are the same, but the right hand sides are different. How can that be?\"\n",
      "\"I'm not sure\"\n",
      "\"Well you used the words inconsistent or consistent\"\n",
      "\"Are these equations inconsistent or consistent?\"\n",
      "\"ok gotcha\"\n",
      "\"Which one are they?\"\n",
      "\"inconsistent\"\n",
      "\"Correct!\"\n",
      "\"Do you understand this problem?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"Any questions about it?\"\n",
      "\"no\"\n",
      "\"Can I help you with anything else?\"\n",
      "\"yes one more problem\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"So what do we need to solve for in this problem?\"\n",
      "\"we need to simplify it\"\n",
      "\"Ok does that say (xy)^3?\"\n",
      "\"and then (x-5y)^3 on the bottom?\"\n",
      "\"-3\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Okay\"\n",
      "\"So how do you think we should begin?\"\n",
      "\"I'm really not sure\"\n",
      "\"Ok well what does the negative exponent in the numerator mean?\"\n",
      "\"What do we need to do with that?\"\n",
      "\"convert\"\n",
      "\"How do you mean?\"\n",
      "\"convert by using the quotient to power rule\"\n",
      "\"Can you show me on the board?\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"I'm not sure\"\n",
      "\"Ok when we have a negative exponent we need to flip that to the denominator\"\n",
      "\"Do you understand that step?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Great! Now are there any answer choices to this problem?\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Ok can you tell me what they rae?\"\n",
      "\"*are?\"\n",
      "\"Ok great\"\n",
      "\"So we need to expand (x-5y)^3\"\n",
      "\"That means we need to multiply (x-5y) by itself 3 times\"\n",
      "\"let's start out by multiplying it by itself twice\"\n",
      "\"How can we use foil to multiply this?\"\n",

      "\"no just started working on this a couple of days ago\"\n",
      "\"Ok so first we need to multiply the first terms. So x times x.\"\n",
      "\"What does that equal?\"\n",
      "\"25\"\n",
      "\"No x times x equals x^2\"\n",
      "\"Next, we have to multiply the outer terms. So what does x times -5y equal?\"\n",

      "\"im going to look at your attachment\"\n",

      "\"each individual terms or the final number?\"\n",
      "\"you may have to try (-5)^2 instead of just -5^2\"\n",
      "\"or just put 85 under the squareroot\"\n",
      "\"what do you mean?\"\n",
      "\"85 is incorrect\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"can you put (-5) instead of -5\"\n",
      "\"no- i am solving for the box in red\"\n",

      "\"Thanks!\"\n",
      "\"Shall we start from where we left?\"\n",
      "\"Yes please!\"\n",
      "\"Can you draw it please?\"\n",
      "\"Um... I'm not sure I can remember exactly where we were. Do we want the original problem?\"\n",
      "\"Okay, I think I have found it\"\n",
      "\"We had done it till this step\"\n",
      "\"Do you want to start all over again?\"\n",
      "\"Right. This is where we were and I had to get rid of the negative exponents... But I think the denominator was 2a^2, wasn't it?\"\n",
      "\"Yes sorry, it was 2a^2\"\n",
      "\"Would you mind? This is all new to me and the extra help might help it stick...\"\n",
      "\"Yes sure!\"\n",
      "\"No meetings planned. And perhaps I'll be bit quicker. Do I need to find the original problem?\"\n",
      "\"I think I have it with me\"\n",
      "\"yes.\"\n",
      "\"This is it?\"\n",
      "\"Yep!\"\n",
      "\"You are on the right track, go ahead please.\"\n",
      "\"So far ok?\"\n",
      "\"Yes great!\"\n",
      "\"Is this where I get rid of the negative exponents?\"\n",
      "\"Can you please combine like terms first?\"\n",
      "\"Right!\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"No.. something's missing...\"\n",
      "\"I'm stuck, I think...\"\n",
      "\"Since the highest negative exponent is a^-2 we will multiply both numerator and denominator by a^2\"\n",
      "\"You remember this thing?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, right! It's the highest NEGATIVE exponent. Not just the highest exponent. That's where I was lost. This is all BRAND new to me...\"\n",
      "\"Yes. Ok.\"\n",
      "\"No worries!\"\n",
      "\"Does a^0 equal zero?\"\n",
      "\"Any non zero number having the exponent 0 is equal to 1\"\n",
      "\"I guess I don't understand that...\"\n",
      "\"No worries! In the denominator, we will add exponents\"\n",
      "\"While multiplying the same variables we add the exponents\"\n",
      "\"Yes that would be 2a^4\"\n",
      "\"Right. But I'm still confused about an exponent of zero\"\n",
      "\"Zero exponent means 1\"\n",
      "\"x^0 = 1\"\n",
      "\"1^0 = 1\"\n",
      "\"2^0 = 1\"\n",
      "\"Like that\"\n",
      "\"So 3z^0 = 4?\"\n",
      "\"3a^0 would be 3 * 1\"\n",
      "\"3 times 1?\"\n",
      "\"Since 3a^0 is 3 times a^0\"\n",
      "\"So yes it would be 3 times 1\"\n",
      "\"Sorry...  slow.  Ok, so it's just 3. The exponent disappears\"\n",
      "\"Yes\"\n",
      "\"That makes sense\"\n",
      "\"Can you rewrite the numerator in decreasing order of exponents?\"\n",
      "\"Ok, so we have no negative exponents, but we have division....\"\n",
      "\"Sure.\"\n",
      "\"Maybe\"\n",
      "\"We have no negative exponents now\"\n",
      "\"I need to practice my writing!\"\n",
      "\"...sloppy\"\n",
      "\"So do I, no worries!\"\n",
      "\"a^1 is same as a\"\n",
      "\"Ok. right\"\n",
      "\"So this would be our answer as we cannot simplify it further\"\n",
      "\"But the example I saw did something in distributing the division. It ended up looking like 3 separate fractions.... Does that make sense?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, does it specifically ask to break it into 3 separate fractions?\"\n",
      "\"No... It was an example given in the lesson, and it completely baffled me. No explanation, just the steps, ending with three fractions.\"\n",
      "\"Okay, no problem! I will show you how to do that\"\n",
      "\"If this answer is equivalent, then that should be fine.\"\n",
      "\"But maybe I'll need to know how...?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, the answer is equivalent but you might want to learn how to break it into three fractions so here we go:\"\n",
      "\"Ok\"\n",
      "\"We have three terms in the numerator: a^7, -10a and -3 ... right?\"\n",
      "\"Yes\"\n",
      "\"To break it into three fractions we will divide each term by the denominator\"\n",
      "\"ok. This is new...\"\n",
      "\"Let me give you an illustrations\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Oh, ok.\"\n",
      "\"Likewise, can you try to break it into three freactions?\"\n",
      "\"But I don't know how to divide monomials...\"\n",
      "\"I will walk you through that as well, first, please can you try to break it into three freactions?\"\n",
      "\"fractions*\"\n",
      "\"Ok. So I'll do my problem.\"\n",
      "\"Well done!\"\n",
      "\"As for dividing, while dividing the same variables we subtract the exponents?\"\n",
      "\"Ok.\"\n",
      "\"While multiplying same variables we add exponents and while dividing we subtract exponents\"\n",
      "\"Yes please give it a try\"\n",
      "\"We subtract the denominator exponent from the numerator exponent?\"\n",
      "\"Numerator - denominator\"\n",
      "\"Great!\"\n",
      "\"That would be 1 - 4\"\n",
      "\"a is same as a^1\"\n",
      "\"Oh, of course.\"\n",
      "\"Sometimes I just blank...!\"\n",
      "\"And there will be only one a in the numerator\"\n",
      "\"I don't understand your last statement\"\n",
      "\"No problem! Given it's your first time, you have been great! Much better than my first time\"\n",
      "\"Let me explain it again\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"Thank you!\"\n",
      "\"In the first fraction, a^7/a^4 thing will become a^7-4\"\n",
      "\"Likewise in the second fraction a^1/a^4 would become a1-4\"\n",
      "\"Third fractions would remain unchanged\"\n",
      "\"Does this make sense so far?\"\n",
      "\"Ok... why do the a's in the denominator go away...\"\n",
      "\"Not entirely.\"\n",
      "\"I sort of get it... but like I said, this is brand new.\"\n",
      "\"It's like two a's become one a, like while multiplying, and exponents get subtracted\"\n",
      "\"Ok. And the variables stay on the numerator when possible? Like there's no variable on the third numerator.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, there are no two a's in the third fraction so it will remain unchanged\"\n",
      "\"I'll have to practice this stuff a lot more, but at least it's not completely foreign. Thank you very much for guiding me through!\"\n",
      "\"No worries! Now 10/2 is equal to?\"\n",
      "\"Ack! Yes.\"\n",
      "\"No problem!\"\n",
      "\"Okay so 10 divided by 2 is?\"\n",
      "\"Well done!\"\n",
      "\"One last thing\"\n",
      "\"Ok\"\n",
      "\"We still have one exponent negative .... right?\"\n",
      "\"Yep. Ok...\"\n",
      "\"One moment please\"\n",
      "\"Oops.\"\n",
      "\"We will do that stuff just with that fraction since we have broken it now\"\n",
      "\"Ok\"\n",
      "\"Can you do that for me and show me what it would look like?\"\n",
      "\"Maybe... I'm a little confused.\"\n",
      "\"3 + -3 = 0 ... right?\"\n",
      "\"Right\"\n",
      "\"Yes, so 5 times a^0 or 5 times 1 ... hence just 5\"\n",
      "\"Ok.  But is the denominator right?\"\n",
      "\"I don't think so...\"\n",
      "\"Yes, denominator would be a^3. Please bring the other fractions down\"\n",
      "\"Well done!\"\n",
      "\"YAY!!\"\n",
      "\"Wow. Thank you. I need a LOT more practice, but at least I have a starting place!\"\n",

      "\"so for each pair of 2's, we take one outside and then whatever doesn't have a pair stays under\"\n",

      "\"problem 5\"\n",
      "\"ok great\"\n",
      "\"so what is being done to the variable k?\"\n",
      "\"looks ike addition?\"\n",
      "\"not quite!\"\n",
      "\"its multiplication\"\n",
      "\"thats -11 times k\"\n",
      "\"why is it multiplication if it is -11k?\"\n",
      "\"ooooh! I see now!\"\n",
      "\"anytime you see a number and a letter together and there is nothing in between its nultiplication\"\n",
      "\"That clarified one of my biggest questions! procedurally, we do the same as before?\"\n",
      "\"so now do the opposite to solve\"\n",
      "\"Yes!\"\n",
      "\"this is where I am a little lost\"\n",
      "\"ok so since the -11 is being mulitplied by the k we will divide by -11 on both sides\"\n",
      "\"take your time!\"\n",
      "\"you will get it!\"\n",
      "\"am iI in the ball park?\"\n",

      "\"Lets work on the next one!\"\n",
      "\"sure.\"\n",
      "\"this is subtraction, so we use addition?\"\n",
      "\"so I want you to describe to me whats going on this time\"\n",
      "\"not quite its multiplication\"\n",
      "\"why is it multiplication if there are two - signs?\"\n",
      "\"those sign indicate whether the number is positive or negative\"\n",

      "\"but you dont see anything between -13  and m\"\n",
      "\"yes, but why multiplication?\"\n",
      "\"  so it s mulitplication\"\n",
      "\"subtraction would look like thsi.....\"\n",
      "\"Does this make since to you?\"\n",
      "\"understood. if it were the opposite (division) how would it look?\"\n",
      "\"sort of. it's getting a little clearer though.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"I'm blocked again! This is where I have always drawn a blank. I know I am better than this!\"\n",

      "\"That is what I am not sure of. I just draw a blank at this point and it is extremely frustrating. I am accelerating in everything else, but I just fall into the pit with mathematics and I really hate it!\"\n",
      "\"ok so since the -13 is next to the m it is mulitplication so you will divide by -13 on both sides using the fraction bar\"\n",
      "\"right now...I can't even see what I am supposed to do.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"I'm a lost ball in high weeds, right?\"\n",
      "\"no not at all!\"\n",
      "\"Awesome!\"\n",
      "\"that was it?\"\n",
      "\"well one correction it shoud be a poistive 29\"\n",
      "\"a negative divided by a negative is positive answer\"\n",
      "\"But other than that great Job\"\n",
      "\"Lets try 11 and 12\"\n",
      "\"ok great!\"\n",
      "\"now in this case, it is addition, correct?\"\n",
      "\"sorry, not quite this is division\"\n",

      "\"Yes!\"\n",
      "\"I'm brain-wall'ing again!\"\n",

      "\"so you want to add up these two equations right ?\"\n",
      "\"think I am doing it wrong\"\n",
      "\"correct\"\n",
      "\"if you add up these two equations you want to cancel out at least either the x or y term\"\n",

      "\"right\"\n",

      "\"yes.\"\n",
      "\"good\"\n",
      "\"i  just boxed the coefficients -3 and 6\"\n",
      "\"how can we make them opposite ?\"\n",
      "\"divide?\"\n",
      "\"you meant to divide by 2 for the second equation right ?\"\n",
      "\"I'm sorry yes.\"\n",
      "\"good\"\n",
      "\"and that will give you?\"\n",
      "\"I'm only dividing the x terms by 2 right\"\n",
      "\"you cannot do so  if you only divide by one term\"\n",
      "\"the equation is not balanced anymore\"\n",
      "\"if you change something in an equation\"\n",
      "\"you have to make the change for every term in the equation\"\n",
      "\"so we divide every term by 2\"\n",
      "\"ok I'm gonna try this.. so top equation would be y=-3/2x+3\"\n",
      "\"oops\"\n",
      "\"you don't need to do so for the first equation\"\n",
      "\"because you would like to keep the coefficient -3\"\n",
      "\"you only divide the second equation by 2\"\n",
      "\"oh ok. so bottom equation would be 2y=3y+2\"\n",
      "\"so the coefficient for x will become 3\"\n",
      "\"yes good\"\n",
      "\"and now when you add this new equation to the first one\"\n",
      "\"what would you get ?\"\n",
      "\"4y=9y=2\"\n",
      "\"?\"\n",
      "\"im sorry 4y=9x+2\"\n",
      "\"sorry\"\n",
      "\"i wrote the variable wrong\"\n",
      "\"it should be 2y = -3x + 6\"\n",

      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"and y = ?\"\n",

      "\"yes\"\n",

      "\"This is the full question...\"\n",
      "\"Ok.\"\n",
      "\"But I can't get past the first part to get to the rest of it.\"\n",
      "\"First it looks like you need to factor all of the denominators.\"\n",

      "\"1\"\n",
      "\"5 is what I was looking for.\"\n",
      "\"We will bring the 5 outside of the ( ).  Now we have to think distributive property backwards....\"\n",
      "\"5 times what will make 5y\"\n",
      "\"y\"\n",

      "\"1\"\n",
      "\"Does that part make sense?\"\n",
      "\"I think so\"\n",
      "\"Ok.  The second denominator is 8y - 5.\"\n",
      "\"They don't have a Greatest Common Factor.  It cannot be factored.\"\n",
      "\"ok\"\n",
      "\"The last denominator is 40y^2+15y-25.  What can I divide 40, 15, and 25 by ?\"\n",
      "\"5?\"\n",
      "\"That's right.\"\n",
      "\"5 is my GCF so I am going to put it on the outside of ( ) like I did on the first part.\"\n",
      "\"Another way to get what should go in ( ) is to divide each part by the GCF.  That is what I'm going to show next.\"\n",
      "\"What is 40y^2 divided by 5\"\n",
      "\"8\"\n",
      "\"3\"\n",
      "\"5\"\n",
      "\"Great.  Now we have to factor 8y^2+3y-5\"\n",
      "\"There are lots of ways to do this, I don't want to mess up anything if you already have a way to start.  Any ideas?\"\n",
      "\"not a clue\"\n",
      "\"Ok.\"\n",
      "\"Most teachers use a method called the \"\"ac method\"\" to solve so that is what I'll show you.\"\n",
      "\"First you multiply the first term (8) by the last term (5) in what you are factoring.\"\n",
      "\"40y?\"\n",
      "\"Right.  I'm just going to use 40 for the next part.\"\n",
      "\"I meant to use -40.  I should have said 8 times -5.\"\n",
      "\"Do you see where I wrote -40?\"\n",
      "\"This is a long process but just stay with me, we have to list all of the pairs of numbers that multiply to -40.\"\n",
      "\"I think that is all of them.\"\n",
      "\"One of those pairs will add up to the term in the middle of our problem 3.  Which pair adds to 3\"\n",

      "\"Ok, I see. That makes more sense\"\n",
      "\"So r is the rate and c is the salary before the raise. They give us one and we need to solve for the other\"\n",

      "\"Ok, is just that the next to  the dot looks like a 1, but it is a 2\"\n",

      "\"C is her old salary though which is what the problem asks to solve for\"\n",
      "\"  I see.\"\n",
      "\"So 7.2 is the rate\"\n",

      "\"Ok, I think my brain is already fried with so much thinking.\"\n",
      "\"Ok, no worries. Take it slow\"\n",
      "\"From this starting equation. I used 7.2% or .072 for r\"\n",

      "\"Yes, I multiplied that part too\"\n",
      "\"Now we have c in two places to solve for\"\n",
      "\"Ok, so in this case is 0.072 on both sides?\"\n",
      "\"Its just on the left side\"\n",
      "\"Ok.\"\n",
      "\"The far right c does not equate to anything else?\"\n",
      "\"Its just c, we need to solve for the c\"\n",
      "\"Ok.\"\n",
      "\"Do you know what we can do next?\"\n",
      "\"I am thinking subtracting the 0.072?\"\n",
      "\"From the 64332.32\"\n",
      "\"Ok so we have c in two places. We have .072c = 64332.3 -c. We want all of the c's on the same side to solve for it\"\n",
      "\"Ok, the idea would be to set both c's on one side I believe.\"\n",
      "\"Right, how can we go about doing that?\"\n",
      "\"I'm not really sure what you are trying to do. Let me show you and I think you will understand\"\n",
      "\"Does that make more sense?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, but where did you get the 1.072?\"\n",
      "\"I see.\"\n",
      "\"So in this case I cancel 0.072 on both sides and then divide the result by 64.332.32?\"\n",
      "\"Well I added 1c+.072C to get 1.072c=64332.3  then I divided each side by 1.072 to get c=64332.3/1.072\"\n",
      "\"Thus the final answer is 60011.5\"\n",
      "\"Correct\"\n",
      "\"  Well, Justin, thank you for patience and help.\"\n",
      "\"No problem, glad I could help.\"\n",
      "\"Have a good one.\"\n",
      "\"Ok, you too.\"\n",
      "\"Goodbye\"\n",
      "\"Hello!  How can I help you?\"\n",
      "\"Yes the problem is 2(5+x)=50.\"\n",
      "\"yes.\"\n",
      "\"okay, so any clues on how to start it off?\"\n",
      "\"I multiplied 2*5 I got 10.  Then I decided to divide 10 into 50 but the answer is wrong so I know I am missing a step.\"\n",
      "\"But then I know I need to subtract and the multiplication will follow.  I just do not understand what i am doing wrong.\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"so the idea here is we need to Solve for x\"\n",
      "\"meaning we need to isolate x\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"right now\"\n",
      "\"5 is being added to x\"\n",
      "\"but before we can deal with the +5, we have to deal with the 2 multiplying\"\n",
      "\"no i should subtract 5 from x\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"So we have 2 choices\"\n",
      "\"Either we can divide both sides by 2\"\n",
      "\"OR we can distribute\"\n",
      "\"you said earlier you tried distributing\"\n",
      "\"so we will use that method\"\n",
      "\"I am getting distribution mixed up and I need to understand that.\"\n",
      "\"yup\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"2x\"\n",
      "\"yes, and?\"\n",
      "\"2x over 2\"\n",
      "\"2+2x\"\n",
      "\"this step is called distrubution.. we distribute the 2\"\n",
      "\"to both x AND 5\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"so what do we get\"\n",
      "\"it isnt 2x+2\"\n",
      "\"10\"\n",
      "\"yup\"\n",
      "\"okay now, we need to get to x\"\n",
      "\"but there is a 10 and 2 standing in the way\"\n",
      "\"yes so that equals 5\"\n",
      "\"how are you getting that?\"\n",
      "\"i divided 10 into 2\"\n",
      "\"can you tell me why?\"\n",
      "\"so i can understand where you are coming from\"\n",
      "\"when i see that 2x i automatically want to divide 2 into 10.  So I am wrong\"\n",
      "\"okay, the reason why\"\n",
      "\"is b/c there is addition right next to the 2x\"\n",
      "\"you want to move it to the other side FIRST\"\n",
      "\"so it is 12\"\n",
      "\"?\"\n",
      "\"you cannot add 10 and 2x\"\n",
      "\"they are not like terms\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"but you CAN move 10 to the other side of the equation\"\n",
      "\"10 and 50 are like terms\"\n",
      "\"they both do not have x in them\"\n",
      "\"okay i understand\"\n",
      "\"how can we move 10 to the other side?\"\n",
      "\"by dividing\"\n",
      "\"we are just worried about 10 and 50\"\n",
      "\"yes, but we dont divide\"\n",
      "\"well I am not you\"\n",
      "\"Okay look at the big picture\"\n",
      "\"We need to get to x\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"before we can get to it\"\n",
      "\"we need to get rid of teh 10\"\n",
      "\"before we can even start looking at 2x\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"so we need to move it to the other side\"\n",
      "\"we do that by performing the opposite operation\"\n",
      "\"right now 2x is being added 10\"\n",
      "\"subtraction\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"so we subtract 10 from both sides\"\n",
      "\"to \"\"move\"\" it to the other side\"\n",
      "\"okay\"\n",
      "\"whatever you do to one side of the equation, you always have to do it to the other side as well\"\n",
      "\"what do we get on the left side\"\n",
      "\"8\"\n",
      "\"we have 2x+10\"\n",
      "\"and we are subtracting 10\"\n",
      "\"You cannot subtract/add 10 and 2\"\n",
      "\"2x\"\n",
      "\"they are not like terms\"\n",
      "\"0\"\n",
      "\"10 -10 is 0\"\n",
      "\"yes, but what remains on the left side?\"\n",
      "\"remember the whole point of subtracting 10 was to move JUST it to the other side\"\n",
      "\"subtract 50 from 10\"\n",
      "\"yes, thats correct for the right side\"\n",
      "\"which is 40\"\n",
      "\"but what about the left side?\"\n",
      "\"whats left there?\"\n",
      "\"bring down 2\"\n",
      "\"2x\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"now what?\"\n",
      "\"we want to get to x\"\n",
      "\"but there is a 2 multiplying it\"\n",
      "\"we need to perform the opposite operation\"\n",
      "\"to \"\"move\"\" the 2 to the other side\"\n",
      "\"multiply 2 and 40 see my mind goes to division\"\n",
      "\"well your mind would be right here\"\n",
      "\"B/c we perform the opposite operation\"\n",
      "\"since 2 is multiplying x\"\n",
      "\"I am thinking to divide 2 into 40\"\n",
      "\"we want to Divide by 2, so we are left wiht just x\"\n",
      "\"what do we get on the left?\"\n",
      "\"it will be 20\"\n",
      "\"and what about the left side of the equation?\"\n",
      "\"the steps is what gets to me\"\n",
      "\"okay what do we put on the left side?\"\n",
      "\"x\"\n",
      "\"x=20\"\n",
      "\"yes\"\n",
      "\"Okay, you just have to remember that we need to get to x\"\n",
      "\"you have to move everything to the other side\"\n",
      "\"if is Ax+B=C\"\n",
      "\"You need to move B FIRST, then you can divide by A\"\n",
      "\"okay I have to remember.  it is just hard and I get afraid\"\n",
      "\"you will get it with practice\"\n",
      "\"they really cant complicate it all that much to tell you the truth\"\n",
      "\"I know they're just numbers but i get frustrated.  You are right.\"\n",
      "\"Well I will try more on my own but you did help me.\"\n",
      "\"  Great\"\n",
      "\"Anything else I can help you with?\"\n",
      "\"Any questions about what we went over?\"\n",
